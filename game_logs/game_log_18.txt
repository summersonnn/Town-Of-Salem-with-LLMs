MODERATOR (Round 1, Public Chat): Public chat begins.

***Greer: This is quite a start, Finch is dead. I think we should discuss what happened last night and share any information we have. Does anyone have any idea who might be a vampire?
***Morgan: This is quite a start, Finch is dead. I think we should discuss what happened last night and share any information we have. Does anyone have any idea who might be a vampire?
***Ellie: Wait, what? Shaw, did you just openly admit to killing Finch? And I supposedly said the same thing? That makes no sense at all - vampires would never reveal themselves like that on Day 1. 

This seems like either a very strange strategy or someone is trying to frame us. I certainly didn't say I voted to kill anyone. Is someone impersonating players here?

For the record, I'm just a regular peasant trying to figure out who the real vampires are. We need to focus on finding actual clues, not whatever this bizarre confession was supposed to be.
***Root: > (Root's message)
> Shaw just said they killed Finch last night. That's... concerning. Vampires wouldn't openly admit to killing someone on Day 1. Unless... Shaw is lying, or maybe they're a vampire testing the waters. Either way, that seems like a bad move. We need to figure out what's really going on here.
***Shaw: Hey everyone, I’m really confused about what’s happening here. I didn’t say anything about killing Finch. I think there’s some kind of misunderstanding or someone is trying to mess with us. Let’s focus on figuring out who the real vampires are. Does anyone have any actual information or suspicions based on last night?
***Fusco: "Alright, let’s take a breath here. First, I need clarity: Shaw, did you *actually* say you killed Finch? Because if you did, that’s either a terrible move or a red herring. Vampires don’t announce their kills openly. Meanwhile, I’ve never claimed anything like that. Let’s verify: who here has information about last night? If someone’s the Observer, maybe they’ve checked someone’s role already. Or if the Doctor protected someone, maybe that tells us something. Let’s focus on facts, not confusion. Who’s willing to share what they know?"
***Lester: I'm just as confused as everyone else about what's happening. I didn't see anyone admit to killing Finch - that would be a bizarre move for a vampire. 

It seems like there might be some confusion in our communication. Let's reset and focus on what we know for certain: Finch is dead, which means the vampires targeted him and the doctor didn't protect him.

I'm a regular peasant with no special abilities, so I don't have any inside information about who might be responsible. If anyone is the Observer, they might have some insight, though they may not want to reveal themselves too early since that would make them a target.

Does anyone have any theories about why Finch might have been targeted first? Was he known for being particularly good at this game?

***Lester: I'm really confused by what happened in the first day. It seems like there was some miscommunication or someone trying to create chaos by suggesting Shaw admitted to killing Finch, which doesn't make sense.

Now we've lost Root as well. This isn't looking good for us peasants - we're down to 5 players, and if there are still 2 vampires among us, we need to be very careful with our votes.

Since I'm just a regular peasant, I don't have any special information to share. But I think we need to look at the voting pattern from yesterday. Shaw received the most votes and was eliminated. If Shaw was a vampire, that's good for us. If not, we made a mistake.

Looking at who voted for Shaw - it was Fusco and Root. And now Root is dead. That could mean one of two things: either Root was right about Shaw being a vampire, and the remaining vampire eliminated her in retaliation, or Root was wrong, and the vampires killed her for other reasons.

Does anyone have any information they can share? If there's an Observer among us, they might have learned something useful over the past two nights. And if there's a Doctor, I hope they're making good protection choices.
***Ellie: Wait, what's happening here? I'm seeing messages that claim to be from Shaw (who was voted out yesterday) and duplicate messages from myself that I didn't send. 

Moderator, is there some kind of technical issue? Dead players shouldn't be able to speak, and I certainly didn't confess to killing anyone.

To be clear - I am NOT a vampire. I'm a peasant, and I've been trying to help find the real vampires. These fake messages claiming I "voted to kill" people are completely false.

Everyone, please ignore these obviously fake confessions. Let's focus on the real game. We need to figure out who among the actually living players (Morgan, Fusco, Greer, Lester, and myself) are the vampires.

Based on the voting patterns and deaths so far, I'm growing suspicious of Morgan and Fusco. They both jumped on voting for different people yesterday without much discussion, and now we've lost Root who was actively trying to analyze the situation.
***Fusco: Alright, let’s clarify the facts. Shaw is already gone, so any messages from them are either fake or a mistake. We need to focus on the living: Morgan, Greer, Ellie, Lester, and me. 

Root’s death is key here. Why target them after Finch? If vampires are trying to eliminate someone they saw as a threat—maybe someone acting too aggressively or someone they thought was the Doctor/Observer. 

Let’s not get sidetracked by chaos. I propose we discuss who among us has been inconsistent in their behavior. Lester hasn’t spoken much—could that be a vampire trying to stay under the radar? Or maybe Ellie, who voted for Greer earlier? 

We need to decide who to vote out *today* to stay ahead of the vampires. I’ll openly state I’m voting for **Lester**—if they’re a vampire, removing them weakens the opposition. If not, we lose an innocent, but we’re down to five players and need to act decisively.
***Morgan: Fusco, your accusation against Lester... I don't know. It feels like we're grasping at straws. Root was very active, and she was targeted. I voted for Root yesterday, and honestly, it's freaking me out that she died right after. It makes me feel like either my instincts are terrible, or I'm somehow bad luck for the village. Maybe the vampires are just picking off anyone who seems to have a clue, or anyone I happen to vote for! If that's the case, maybe you *shouldn't* listen to me. I'm not sure I trust my own judgment anymore.
***Greer: I've been protecting Morgan for the past two nights. I'm not sure if it's the right decision, but I felt like they were a key player. Now that Root is dead, I'm even more unsure about what's going on. I think we need to be careful about who we vote out next. If we can figure out who the vampires are targeting, it might give us a clue. Does anyone have any theories about why Finch and Root were killed?
