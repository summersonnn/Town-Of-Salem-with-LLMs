***Shaw: Wow, they went after Jeff right away. That’s bold. Anyone have any suspicions or weird vibes from last night? I mean, it’s early, but sometimes people slip up.
***Sarah: No, we shouldn't reveal our votes or discuss specific actions taken during the night. Let's keep the conversation general for now. I'm just trying to process what happened to Jeff. Does anyone have any information or theories?
***Root: Okay, everyone. Jeff is gone. We're down to seven players. It's understandable that we're all processing this loss. Jeff was a player, and his absence is definitely felt.

It's important to remember that we don't know who the vampires are, or even if they knew who Jeff was before the night. Sometimes, vampires target players they think are weak or trying to eliminate a specific role. Sometimes, it's just random.

Let's be careful not to jump to conclusions or start accusing people right away. We need to gather information and discuss possibilities calmly.

I, for one, am the Doctor. My ability is passive; I protect someone each night, but I don't actively investigate or accuse. I need to be cautious and think about who might be vulnerable or perhaps a lone wolf.

What are your thoughts? Who might the vampires be targeting next? Or are we just trying to figure out the best way to work together as a community? Let's keep our discussions open and consider all possibilities.
***Lester: Hey everyone, it's a tough start losing Jeff right off the bat. I think we need to be cautious and not rush into accusations without solid reasoning. Root, I appreciate you trying to keep things general, and Shaw, thanks for sharing your thoughts as the Doctor. It’s risky to reveal a role this early, but I respect the transparency. For now, I’m just trying to get a read on everyone. Does anyone else have any gut feelings or observations from how things are playing out so far? Let’s keep the discussion open and see if we can piece anything together.
***Morgan: "Shaw, you mentioned being the Doctor. If that’s true, why didn’t Jeff survive the night? Protecting villagers is your job, right? Maybe you’re not the real Doctor—or maybe you’re hiding something. Either way, this feels off. Let’s not ignore this."
***Elias: The situation’s tense, but let’s not jump to conclusions. If Shaw is indeed the Doctor, they might’ve chosen to protect someone else for a reason—maybe they thought another player was in more danger, or they’re playing a long game. Accusations without evidence could backfire. We need to consider: Vampires might be trying to sow discord here. Maybe the real Doctor is someone else, or maybe Shaw is telling the truth. Let’s hear from others—does anyone have observations from last night? Also, remember the Clown’s goal is to get voted out, so someone might be trying to redirect suspicion. Let’s focus on building trust and sharing *non-specific* thoughts.
***Fusco: I think we need to be careful here. Accusing Shaw without concrete evidence could backfire—maybe they’re genuine, or maybe they’re trying to throw us off. Let’s focus on what we *know*: Jeff was killed, and we need to figure out why the Doctor didn’t protect him. If Shaw *is* the Doctor, they might have a reason for prioritizing someone else. If they’re not… well, that’s a problem. But let’s not rush to judgment. The Clown’s goal is to get voted out, so someone might be trying to manipulate this. Let’s hold off on direct accusations for now and see if patterns emerge. If we vote someone out too soon, we risk losing a key player—like the Observer or even a Musketeer, if they’re among us. Let’s keep talking, share observations, and build a clearer picture.
