***Elias: I think we should focus on figuring out who the vampires are. Since Devon was killed, maybe we can start by discussing who might have had a motive. I'm a bit suspicious of Shaw, but I'm not sure. What do others think?

Okay, let's start by understanding the game setup. There are 8 players: 2 Vampires, 1 Observer, 1 Clown, 1 Doctor, 1 Musketeer, and 2 regular Peasants. The Vampires know each other, so they can coordinate. The goal is to eliminate all Vampires if you're a Peasant, or reach parity if you're a Vampire. The Clown wants to be voted out.

Night 1: Devon was killed. The Vampires (Elias and Reese) voted, resulting in a tie between Carter and Devon. The moderator randomly picked Devon. So, the Vampires tried to kill either Carter or Devon, but Devon died. Now, the remaining players are Greer, Elias, Carter, Root, Jeff, Reese, Shaw.

As Elias, who is a Vampire, my role is to pretend to be a Peasant and avoid suspicion. The other Vampire is Reese. Our goal is to mislead the others and eliminate Peasants without being caught.

In the Day 1 discussion, Elias needs to blend in. He should express suspicion towards someone else, maybe Shaw, to divert attention. He should avoid drawing suspicion on himself or Reese. Since the Vampires know each other, they might have a strategy to frame others. The Doctor might have protected someone, but since Devon died, the Doctor either didn't protect him or the Vampires targeted someone else. Wait, the Vampires targeted Devon, and if the Doctor didn't protect him, that's why he died. So the Doctor's protection failed or wasn't on Devon.

Elias, as a Vampire, should try to appear helpful. He might suggest discussing motives or analyzing the kill. He could question why Devon was targeted, maybe implying Devon had a role that threatened the Vampires. But since the Vampires just want to kill Peasants, they might target randomly or go for high-threat roles like the Doctor or Observer.

Elias needs to avoid being too aggressive. He should let others take the lead in accusing, maybe support a suspicion towards a non-Vampire. Since the Vampires are Elias and Reese, they should avoid conflict between themselves. If someone else accuses Shaw, Elias can agree, but he should be cautious not to overdo it.

Also, the Clown's presence complicates things. The Clown wants to be voted out, so they might act suspiciously on purpose. But the Clown can't reveal their role, so they might try to provoke votes without being obvious. Elias should be aware that the Clown might be trying to get lynched, so he shouldn't accidentally help the Clown win by voting them out.

In summary, Elias's move is to participate in the discussion, express mild suspicion towards a non-Vampire (like Shaw), and gather information from others' reactions. He should avoid suspicion on himself and Reese, and try to steer the group towards lynching a Peasant or the Clown, but preferably a Peasant to further the Vampire's goal.

Elias: Alright, let's start by analyzing the night kill. Devon was taken out, which is a big loss. I’m a bit suspicious of Shaw because they’ve been quiet so far. What do others think about Shaw’s behavior? Maybe we should also consider who might have crucial roles. The Doctor could have protected someone, but since there was a kill, maybe they didn’t target Devon. Let’s hear from others—any thoughts on who might be a threat?
***Reese: Hmm. So Devon is dead. Interesting. I think we need to consider who might have protected someone last night. If the Doctor was targeting someone else, that explains why Devon wasn't saved. I’m suspicious of Greer—why did they suddenly jump into accusing Shaw so quickly? Maybe they’re trying to distract us. Or maybe Carter here—since he openly admitted voting for Devon, is that a coincidence or a ploy? Let’s hear from Jeff and Root. Who saw anything last night?
***Shaw: Hmm. So Devon is dead. Interesting. I think we need to consider who might have protected someone last night. If the Doctor was targeting someone else, that explains why Devon wasn't saved. I’m suspicious of Greer—why did they suddenly jump into accusing Shaw so quickly? Maybe they’re trying to distract us. Carter, what are your thoughts? And let’s hear from Jeff and Root. Who saw anything last night?
***Greer: Hey everyone, I think we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions too quickly. I agree that it's odd Shaw has been quiet, but that alone isn't enough to point fingers. Elias, you mentioned Shaw, but what specifically makes you suspicious? I'm also curious about what Carter, Jeff, and Root think about last night's events. We lost Devon, and we need to figure out why the vampires might have targeted them. Any ideas on who could be hiding something?
***Root: I protected Greer last night, and it seems it wasn't Devon I was protecting, so that worked out. I'm still trying to figure out who the vampires are. Elias seems a bit too eager to accuse Shaw. I'm not sure what to make of that yet. Let's keep discussing and see if we can gather more information before making any decisions.
***Jeff: Hold on, that’s a big claim you just made about protecting Greer. Why announce that you’re the Doctor so early? You could be painting a target on your back—or maybe you’re not really the Doctor at all and just trying to mislead us. Right now, I’m not sure who to trust. Let’s not jump to conclusions about who’s telling the truth, but that revelation feels like it should put you in the spotlight for questions. Anyone else have thoughts on this claim?
***Carter: "If the Doctor is genuine, they've taken a big risk revealing themselves. That could mean they're confident in their ability to protect others—or they're bluffing to throw us off. Let's also consider: the vampires killed Devon, so they might target someone else tomorrow night. We need to protect key roles if we can identify them. Shaw's silence is odd, but Elias's eagerness to point fingers also feels calculated. Let's hear from Root and Jeff—have either of you noticed anything suspicious about Greer, Elias, or Shaw that might help us decide who to trust?"
