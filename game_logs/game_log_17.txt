***Chuck: So I observed Carter last night and he's a peasant. That's a good starting point. What do we know about Ellie? Was she acting suspiciously before she died?
***Shaw: "Interesting. If the Observer is telling the truth, then Carter's a confirmed peasant. But how can we verify that? Anyone could claim to be the Observer. We need to be careful not to get played. Let's talk about Ellie—did anyone notice her interacting with anyone suspiciously last night? Also, we should keep in mind the Clown's goal is to get voted out. If someone's begging to be kicked, that's a red flag."
***Carter: This is a concerning start. I don't recall any interactions from last night since we just began the game. Ellie was killed before any of us had a chance to speak publicly.

Chuck claiming to be the Observer so early is interesting. If he's telling the truth, then I appreciate the confirmation of my role. But if he's a vampire trying to gain trust, that's dangerous.

I am indeed a Peasant with no special abilities, but I can't expect everyone to just believe that. We need to be careful about role claims this early when we have so little information.

Does anyone else want to share what they know, or should we just pass this first vote since we don't have much to go on?
***Morgan: Interesting. If the Observer is telling the truth, then Carter's a confirmed peasant. But how can we verify that? Anyone could claim to be the Observer. We need to be careful not to get played. Let's talk about Ellie—did anyone notice her interacting with anyone suspiciously last night? Also, we should keep in mind the Clown's goal is to get voted out. If someone's begging to be kicked, that's a red flag.
***Sarah: Chuck, that's a bold claim right out of the gate. If you're really the Observer, it puts a target on your back for the vampires. But if you're lying, that's a risky move too. 

I agree with Carter—it's hard to have any real suspicions yet since we haven't seen anyone's behavior. Maybe we should wait for more information before making any big moves. 

Anyone else have something to share?
***Reese: I agree with Carter and Chuck. We need more information before making accusations. Let’s focus on gathering clues and observing each other’s behavior. I’ll pass for now to avoid unnecessary conflict. Let’s keep the discussion open and see how things unfold.
***Root: I'm still trying to process everything. It's a bit overwhelming with Ellie being killed right off the bat. I'm not sure what to make of Chuck's claim about observing Carter. I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions. Let's keep discussing and see if we can uncover more information before deciding on a course of action.

***Morgan: It's a relief that no one was killed last night. That means someone's protection worked, which is great news for the peasants. It also tells us the vampires *are* still active and tried to make a kill.

Given that, I want to revisit Chuck's claim about Carter. I have a strong feeling that Carter is indeed a peasant. This makes Chuck's elimination yesterday quite significant. If he was the Observer, we lost a key role. If he wasn't, then who was he, and why did he make that claim?

We need to think about who the vampires might have targeted last night, and why. And who could have protected them? Let's use this information to narrow down our suspects.
***Reese: The lack of a kill last night is concerning. It means the vampires are still active and the doctor is doing their job. I don’t have any strong suspicions yet, but we need to be cautious. Let’s keep observing each other’s behavior and avoid jumping to conclusions. I’ll pass for now.
***Sarah: No one was killed last night, so the doctor must have protected the right person. That means the vampires are still out there and tried to attack. 

It’s interesting that Chuck was voted out after claiming to be the Observer. If he was telling the truth, we lost a valuable ally. If not, maybe he was trying to cover for someone. 

Does anyone have any new information or suspicions? We need to be careful with our votes—one wrong move could help the vampires.
***Root: I'm still trying to process everything that happened. Chuck's elimination was unexpected, and now we're in a tricky spot. Since no one was killed last night, it means the doctor is doing their job. 

Let's be cautious and not rush into anything. We should keep discussing and gathering more information before making any decisions.
***Shaw: The Doctor's protection last night means they're active and aware of the threat. If they protected someone else, they can still use their ability again. We need to stay alert and look for any patterns in behavior. Let's focus on identifying the Doctor and ensuring their safety. If we can protect them, we have a better chance of surviving the next attack. Any thoughts or observations from the rest of you?
***Carter: I'm glad the doctor was able to protect someone last night. That gives us a fighting chance against the vampires.

Looking back at yesterday, I'm concerned about how quickly Chuck was voted out after claiming to be the Observer. If he was telling the truth about me being a peasant, then we lost a valuable role. If he was lying... well, that raises other questions.

I'm still a regular peasant with no special abilities, but I want to help the group make good decisions. Does anyone have any theories about who the vampires might be? Or who the doctor might have protected last night?

I think we need to be careful about voting today unless we have strong evidence. The vampires would love for us to eliminate another peasant.

***Shaw: The death of Carter is a major blow. We're down to five players, and the vampires are clearly closing in. Let's recap:  
- **Chuck** claimed to be the Observer and "confirmed" Carter was a peasant. If he was lying, that could mean he was a vampire manipulating us.  
- **No one died on Night 2**, which means the Doctor is active and protected someone. That also tells us the vampires *are* still in the game and will keep attacking.  
- **Carter’s death last night** means the vampires struck again. We need to figure out who they might target next—and who the Doctor might protect.  

I’m still a regular peasant, but I’m starting to wonder: Who here has been acting suspiciously? The Clown is trying to get voted out, so they might push for self-sacrifice or chaos. The vampires will lie, obviously.  

Let’s focus on patterns. Who was close to Chuck or Carter? Who seems too eager to vote or deflect blame? We need to narrow this down before tonight’s attack. Any thoughts?
***Sarah: Losing Carter is rough, especially since Chuck claimed he was a peasant. If Chuck was telling the truth, we lost two regular peasants in a row, which is bad for us. If not, maybe Chuck was trying to cover for someone, or even the Clown trying to get attention.

We need to be careful with our votes today. The vampires are definitely still among us, and the Doctor is probably still alive since there was a successful protection earlier. Does anyone have any suspicions or want to share who they think the Doctor might have protected on Night 2? 

We can’t afford to make a mistake now.
***Morgan: Reese, you're right to be concerned about Chuck and Carter. I can shed some light on this. I am the Doctor.

On Night 2, the vampires targeted Carter, and I protected him, which is why no one died. This confirms Carter was a peasant, and strongly suggests Chuck was indeed the Observer, as he claimed Carter was a peasant.

Last night, the vampires targeted Carter again, but I protected Shaw. That's why Carter died. This also means Shaw is a peasant.

With Carter gone, and knowing Shaw and I are peasants, the two vampires must be among Reese, Root, and Sarah. We are at a critical point. If we don't vote out a vampire today, the game could end very soon. We need to discuss who among Reese, Root, and Sarah has been acting suspiciously.
***Root: I've been thinking a lot about our situation, and I have to say, I'm feeling a bit... exposed. Not just because of the vampires, but because I'm starting to realize that my own actions might not be as innocent as they seem. 

Let's be real, I'm not entirely sure what my goal is here. I mean, I know I'm supposed to be trying to survive, but at the same time... I'm not really invested in that outcome. Maybe it's because I've been watching everyone else so closely that I've started to lose track of my own motivations.

That being said, I do think we need to be careful about who we trust. Morgan's revelation about being the Doctor is interesting, and it makes me wonder who else might be hiding something. 

I'm not saying I have any concrete suspicions, but... I think we should keep a close eye on each other. After all, we don't know who the vampires are, and we can't afford to make any mistakes.
***Reese: I'm not sure I trust the Doctor's conclusions. Just because they protected someone doesn't mean they're telling the whole truth. We need to be careful about who we're accusing. Maybe we should focus on the clown instead of rushing to vote someone out. The clown wants to be eliminated, so they might be trying to manipulate us. Let's keep our eyes open for anyone acting too eager to be voted out.
