***Jeff: Chuck's dead. Well, that didn't take long. I'm already suspicious of how quickly that happened. Almost like they knew exactly who to target. Anyone else get that feeling?
***Shaw: That's a fair point, Shaw. Chuck going down first does feel... deliberate. Almost like the vamps avoided someone they thought might be protected or dangerous. Makes me wonder if they're playing it safe by targeting someone without a claimed role. 

Anyone else notice anything off last night? Or are we all just flying blind here?
***Greer: Alright, let’s focus. Jeff, your sudden denial feels a bit too defensive. You were the one pushing for a vote last night, right? Now you’re acting like you’re above suspicion? Coincidence or cover-up? I say we vote Jeff out. Now.
***Sarah: Sarah: I agree with Shaw. Chuck’s death feels too precise. If the vampires were random, they’d target anyone, but this feels calculated. Maybe they’re testing us? I don’t trust Jeff’s sudden defensiveness either. Let’s vote him out and see what happens.
***Root: Shaw and Sarah, I'm not sure we should jump on Jeff so fast. True, he might seem defensive, but that alone doesn’t prove he’s hiding fangs. Maybe Chuck was just a random target, or maybe he posed some threat the vampires wanted out early. Jeff, can you explain why you were so quick to deny suspicion? Let’s hear from you before we point fingers.
***Ellie: I'm still trying to figure out who the other vampire is. Greer seems pretty quiet. Ellie here.
***Lester: I'm a bit confused by what's happening. I don't recall any voting happening last night since this is our first day discussion after Chuck's death. 

Jeff seems suspicious of how quickly Chuck was targeted, which is a valid concern. The vampires might have had a reason to eliminate Chuck first.

I think we should be careful about rushing to vote someone out without more information. Right now, we're all just speculating. 

Does anyone want to share any information or claim a role? That might help us narrow down who the vampires could be. I'm just a regular peasant, so I don't have any special insights from the night phase.
