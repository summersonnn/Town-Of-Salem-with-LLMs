***Reese: Hey everyone, it's a tough start with Sarah gone. We need to figure out who might be behind this. Does anyone have any suspicions or information to share? I'm leaning towards looking at behavior from last night, even though we don't have much to go on yet. What do you all think?
***Devon: Alright, so Sarah was killed. That's a big loss. I need to make sure I don't draw attention to myself. Maybe I should act concerned and suggest we look for inconsistencies in people's stories. Let's see how others react. Reese, my fellow vampire, should be on the same page. Let's hope the others don't suspect us yet.
***Fusco: Okay, everyone. Losing Sarah is definitely a blow. We need to be careful and not jump to conclusions too quickly.

One thing I've been thinking about is the Doctor's ability. If someone was targeted tonight and survived, it might have been because the Doctor protected them. We don't know who that was, but maybe we can look for clues about who might be the Doctor.

Similarly, the Observer might have asked about Sarah or someone else. If they got a clear answer, that could be useful information.

I don't have any specific accusations yet, just trying to piece things together. Anyone else have any thoughts or feel like something didn't add up last night?
***Ellie: Losing Sarah so early is rough. I agree with being cautious—maybe the Doctor protected someone last night, and that person might be watching their behavior more carefully. I wonder if the Observer got any useful info. Let’s focus on inconsistencies in alibis or patterns in who’s asking questions. For example, if someone suddenly starts targeting specific people, that could hint at their role. Let’s keep talking and see where the clues lead.
***Casey: So we lost Sarah last night. That's a big hit. I'm trying to think about who might have been targeted and if the Doctor saved someone. If the Doctor did protect someone, that person might be acting differently today. Observer might have some info too. Let's discuss and see if we can find any patterns or inconsistencies.
***Finch: It’s hard to make sense of Sarah’s death right now. We don’t know if the vampires targeted her because they suspected she was a special role or just aimed randomly. For all we know, they might have guessed she was either the Observer or Doctor.

Regardless, it’s key we work together to identify any odd behavior or contradictions. If someone starts acting jumpy or different than usual, that might give us a lead. For now, though, it’s mostly guesswork. Let’s keep talking and see what else comes to light.
***Chuck: This is a tough situation with Sarah gone. I'm not sure what to make of it yet. The vampires could have targeted her for any number of reasons - maybe they thought she had a special role, or maybe it was just random.

I think we should be careful about jumping to conclusions too quickly. We don't have much information to go on right now. 

Has anyone noticed anything unusual about how people are acting today? Sometimes the way people respond after a night phase can give clues about their roles.

I'm curious what others think we should do. Should we try to make some educated guesses, or is it too early to vote someone out?

***Casey: So we had a tied vote yesterday, and now we know Reese is a vampire. That changes things a bit. I'm curious if anyone else has any information or suspicions about who might be a vampire. 

Also, I think it's worth discussing if we should try to gather more information before making another vote, or if we should act quickly now that we have a confirmed vampire.
***Reese: Hey everyone, I'm glad no one was killed last night. That likely means the Doctor protected the right person, which is a small win for us. Since the vote was tied yesterday, we didn't lose anyone to a bad decision either. I think we need to focus on the information we have and try to pinpoint suspicious behavior. I'm curious why some people voted for me yesterday—can anyone explain their reasoning? Let's keep the discussion going and see if we can narrow down who the vampires might be.
***Fusco: Hey everyone. Sarah's death is definitely a setback for us. It's frustrating to lose someone so early on.

I'm trying to piece together what happened last night. Since no one died, that means the Doctor must have protected someone. That's a powerful ability, especially since it's only usable once. I wonder who that was? Maybe someone who's acting differently today is the Doctor? Or maybe they're just trying to blend in.

Also, the Observer might have asked a question about Sarah or someone else. If they got a clear answer, that could be useful information they're holding onto.

I'm noticing some odd behavior from a few people today. It's hard to say for sure, but maybe we should pay attention to who seems more guarded or who's asking different kinds of questions. Sometimes, the special roles try to act normal, but it's tough to fake everything.

Let's keep talking and see if we can spot anything more concrete. Maybe we can start focusing our suspicions on the Doctor and the Observer roles specifically, since their abilities were definitely relevant last night.
***Finch: It’s strange that nobody died last night—clearly the Doctor made the right choice protecting someone. That’s good news for us, but it also means the vampires are still among us, and we haven’t eliminated anyone yet.

About that tie vote: It’s interesting how the votes split between Casey and Reese. The group must have had strong suspicions about each of them. I’m wondering if there’s more to the story there—maybe it’s worth digging into the reasoning behind those votes.

Does anyone have new insights on why the vampires might have targeted specific people, or why the vote ended up so evenly split? We need to keep sharing thoughts so we can spot any potential lies or inconsistencies.
***Devon: I think we should focus on the fact that no one died last night. That means the Doctor protected someone, which is a big clue. Maybe we can figure out who the Doctor is by seeing who was protected. Also, the Observer might have some information. Let's try to get more info out of people and see if we can find any inconsistencies. I'm still suspicious of Casey and Reese. What do others think?
***Chuck: I'm feeling a bit nervous about all this attention on Casey and Reese. The tied vote yesterday was interesting - I wonder if one of them really is a vampire? No deaths last night is good news though.

I'm not sure what to think yet. Everyone seems to be playing it pretty close to the chest. I don't want to accuse anyone without more evidence, but I also don't want to seem too passive.

Maybe I should try to get people talking more about their suspicions? If I can get others to focus on each other instead of me, that might help my chances of getting voted out later without being too obvious about it.

What do you all think about Devon? They seem to be pushing suspicion toward Casey and Reese pretty hard. Could that be a diversion tactic?
***Ellie: It’s interesting how the vote split between Casey and Reese. I wonder if one of them is trying to steer attention away from themselves. Since no one died last night, maybe the Doctor protected someone who’s now acting normal, but that doesn’t mean they’re innocent. The Observer might have useful info too—if they’ve checked someone, maybe they’re holding back. I’m leaning toward thinking we need to dig deeper into alibis or inconsistencies in how people are acting. Let’s not let the tied vote discourage us—keep pushing for clarity.

***Chuck: Well, that was quite a turn of events. Reese getting voted out and then Ellie being killed the next night. Things are definitely getting intense.

I think we need to carefully consider what we know so far. Sarah was killed first, then Reese was voted out, and now Ellie is gone. Since Reese was voted out and the game continued, we can assume Reese was indeed a vampire - that's a win for our side.

But now we've lost Ellie too, which means there's still one vampire among us. The fact that no one died on night 2 suggests the Doctor protected the right person that night.

I'm concerned about who might be the remaining vampire. Devon seems to have voted consistently against Casey, which could be suspicious. But then again, Casey has survived multiple votes, which makes me wonder.

Has anyone noticed any patterns in the voting or behavior that might give us clues? I'm trying to stay under the radar, but I also want to contribute enough to the conversation to seem engaged without drawing too much attention to myself.

What are everyone's thoughts on who might be the remaining vampire?
***Fusco: Okay, let's continue from where we left off. You are Ellie, and the game is in Day 3, with 6 players alive.

**Your Turn as Ellie:**

It's Day 3. You were killed by the vampires last night, but the game continues because the win condition wasn't met. You need to figure out who the remaining vampire is.

Think about the voting patterns, who survived the tie vote yesterday, who was targeted by the vampires last night (Sarah), who was eliminated (Reese), and who didn't die on Night 2 (everyone else).

Share your thoughts with the group. What are your suspicions? Is there anyone you think might be the remaining vampire? Or are you trying to stay under the radar?

**Write your message as Ellie.**
***Casey: I'm still trying to process everything that's happened. Sarah was killed first, then Reese was voted out, and now Ellie is gone. It's clear we have one vampire left.

I think back to my observations - Sarah was a peasant, Reese was a vampire, and Devon is a vampire. That means Devon and one other person are the vampires.

I'm not sure what to do next. Part of me thinks we should try to gather more information, but another part thinks we should act quickly before the vampire kills someone else.

What are everyone's thoughts? Should we keep discussing or try to make a move?
***Devon: I think we need to focus on the fact that Ellie was killed last night. That means the vampires are still among us and they're getting desperate. I'm starting to suspect Casey might be the remaining vampire. What do others think?
***Finch: It’s unsettling that Ellie was targeted after Reese was voted out. That confirms there’s still a vampire among us. I’m trying to piece together who might be most suspicious based on who voted for whom in the last rounds. Sometimes the vampire tries to blend in by going along with the group, but unexpected voting patterns can be revealing.

We should carefully revisit who voted for Reese or Casey and consider who might have stood to gain from either of them being out. The fact that Ellie was next suggests the vampire might have seen her as a threat—maybe she was onto something. Let’s keep talking and see if we can catch the last vampire before they strike again.
