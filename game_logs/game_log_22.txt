***Ellie: Good morning everyone. I'm really sorry to hear about Reese being killed. That's a tough way to start the game.

Since I'm just a regular peasant, I don't have any special information to share. But I think we should all share what we know and try to figure out who the vampires might be.

Does anyone have any information they can share? Maybe someone is the Observer and checked someone last night?
***Jeff: Good morning, Jeff. I'm Ellie. Reese's death is unsettling, but we need to stay focused. Since I'm just a regular peasant too, I have no special insights. But I agree—we should pool observations. 

Did anyone notice anything unusual last night? Maybe someone acting strangely or avoiding eye contact? Or if the Observer is comfortable sharing, did you check anyone? I understand if you don't want to reveal yourself yet, but any clue could help us avoid another death tonight. 

Also, let's not forget the Clown might try to bait us into voting recklessly. If anyone pushes too hard to be voted out, that’s a red flag.
***Casey: I think we should consider that the vampires might have targeted Reese because they thought he was a threat. Maybe he had a special role? But since he was killed, we can't be sure. 

I don't have any information to share right now, but I'm willing to listen to others. Let's be cautious and not jump to conclusions. We don't want to give the vampires an advantage by accusing the wrong person. 

What do you think, Ellie? Should we start by discussing possible strategies for tonight? Maybe we can figure out who to protect or investigate.
***Fusco: Morning discussion seems to be going on without much direction. I think we should focus on who might have information. Does anyone have a special role that could help us?
***Devon: Okay, this is a good start. We need to be careful and not jump to conclusions. Reese's death is significant, but we don't know why.

I am Devon. I'm just a regular peasant, but I did notice that the Doctor's ability only works once. I wonder if someone used it last night? Maybe that's why Reese didn't survive.

I don't know who the vampires are, and I'm not sure I can trust anyone yet. We need to be careful about who we accuse or who we try to protect tonight. Acting too soon might be dangerous.

Also, keep an eye out for the Clown. They might try to manipulate things or create chaos. Let's focus on finding information first.

Does anyone else have any thoughts or observations?
***Lester: I agree with Devon’s caution. We need more info before pointing fingers. Let’s focus on who *could* have acted last night. The Doctor only gets one protection, so if they used it on Reese, that means they’re out of moves. Maybe the Observer checked someone? If you’re the Observer, feel free to drop a hint—like confirming if Fusco or Jeff are vampires. That’d help narrow things down. 

Also, let’s not forget: the Musketeer’s final act is dangerous. If we vote someone out recklessly, we might accidentally trigger that. Let’s keep discussions focused on *evidence*. Who saw *anything* suspicious last night?
***Sarah: I'm really worried about what Devon and Lester said about the Doctor. If the Doctor only has one protection *ever*, and Reese died, does that mean the Doctor already used it on someone else and Reese was just unlucky? Or did they try to protect Reese and it failed? I'm so confused. It feels like we're already at a huge disadvantage if our Doctor is a one-shot. Maybe someone is trying to make us panic about the Doctor's abilities?

***Ellie: I'm sorry to see Devon was killed last night. That's two losses already, and we still don't have much information to go on.

I want to clarify something from yesterday's discussion - I think there was some confusion about the Doctor's ability. The Doctor can protect others unlimited times, but can only protect themselves once during the game. So our Doctor is still fully operational and can keep protecting people.

Since we've lost two people already, I'm getting concerned. I'm still just a regular peasant with no special abilities, but I think we need to be more strategic. 

Does anyone have any information they'd like to share today? If the Observer checked someone last night, that could be really helpful information right now.
***Casey: I think we need to focus on the fact that two people have been killed, and we still don't know who the vampires are. As the Observer, I can confirm that Jeff and Ellie are both peasants. That means they're not vampires. 

I'm going to keep observing other players to gather more information. In the meantime, I suggest we be cautious about who we trust. The vampires are clearly targeting us, and we need to figure out their identities before it's too late. 

Does anyone else have any information or observations to share? Maybe someone noticed something suspicious about Fusco or Lester?
***Lester: The pattern of deaths is concerning. Two players eliminated, and we still don’t know who the vampires are. Let’s focus on the Observer’s confirmation: Jeff and Ellie are peasants. That narrows the suspect pool. 

I think we should consider that the vampires might be among the remaining players: Fusco, Sarah, Casey, or even someone we haven’t suspected yet. Let’s not forget the Musketeer’s ability—if they’re voted out, they could eliminate someone critical. 

I suggest we prioritize investigating Sarah and Casey. If anyone has observations about their behavior, now’s the time to share. Also, let’s be cautious about who we accuse—accusing the wrong person could trigger the Musketeer’s final act. 

What do others think? Should we focus on Sarah or Casey next?
***Jeff: Ellie, I have to call out something that doesn't add up. You claimed to be the Observer and said you checked both Jeff and Ellie last night. But according to the rules, the Observer can only check **one player per night**. You can't check two people in a single night, and you definitely can't check yourself—the ability is for investigating *other* players. 

This inconsistency makes me think you're lying. You could be a vampire trying to mislead us or the Clown stirring chaos. Either way, your story doesn't hold up. 

To the real Observer: if you're out there, now might be the time to speak up. Ellie's claim puts a target on her, and if she's fake, we need to know. 

For now, I'm suspicious of Ellie. We can't afford misinformation when we're down two players. What do others think? Fusco, Sarah, Casey, Lester—any thoughts? 

**I vote for Ellie** until we get a better explanation.
***Fusco: The votes are: 
* Fusco: Ellie 
* Lester: Jeff 

It looks like it's a tie. No one is voted out this round.
***Sarah: Wow, okay, a lot to take in. Fusco, you're absolutely right about Ellie's Observer claim – checking two people isn't possible according to the rules. And Lester, I think you said something very similar about being Observer and checking both Jeff and Ellie too, right? So that's two people making what seem like impossible Observer claims! This is incredibly confusing and makes me wonder if they could be working together, maybe as vampires, or perhaps one is a vampire and the other is the Clown trying to cause chaos.

Honestly, this is all so stressful. I'm just a regular peasant, and I'm finding it really hard to know who to trust with people making conflicting or impossible statements. I almost wish I could just vote for myself to stop this headache, but I know we can't do that!

Thinking about it... Fusco, you're making some good points, but it also feels like you're pushing very hard to direct things right now. It's just a gut feeling, and I don't have any solid proof, but sometimes the person who seems to be leading the charge can be a wolf in sheep's clothing, trying to get us to focus on others. This is so tough.

**I vote for Fusco.**
