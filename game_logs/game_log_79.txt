***Finch: Good morning everyone! Well, it seems like I made a good choice last night. I'm the Doctor and I protected Reese, which means the vampires must have targeted them. This gives us some useful information right away - Reese is likely not a vampire since they were targeted.

I know revealing my role early is risky, but I think it's important we start sharing information quickly. Does anyone else want to share their role or any suspicions?
***Carter: Good morning. The Doctor's revelation gives us a solid lead—Reese was targeted, so they're likely a Peasant. That narrows down the vampire possibilities to the remaining six. Does anyone else have insights? Maybe the Observer checked someone last night? We should pool information to root out the vampires before they outnumber us. Let’s stay cautious of anyone pushing too hard to be voted out… *cough*Clown*cough*.
***Greer: Hmm, let’s break this down. The Doctor’s intervention saved Reese, which means the vampires clearly saw Reese as a threat. But why? Maybe they suspected Reese of being a vampire? Or perhaps Reese has been acting suspiciously? Either way, we need to figure out who among us might be hiding their true role. 

I’m curious—did anyone else notice anything odd last night? The fact that Reese was targeted suggests the vampires are testing our loyalties. Meanwhile, the Clown’s goal is to get voted out, so someone might be pushing for an obvious target to throw us off. Let’s not jump to conclusions yet. Who here has a role that can provide more information tonight? The Observer could check someone’s identity, and the Musketeer might want to stay alive to use their final ability if needed. Let’s hear from others before we decide who to eliminate.
***Elias: As Elias, you are currently in the Day 1 discussion phase. Your previous messages about voting are for a later phase, and your night actions have already been processed by the moderator.

Remember, you are Elias, a Vampire. Your goal is to eliminate peasants and avoid suspicion. You need to participate in the public discussion as if you are a peasant trying to figure out who the vampires are.

Consider the information revealed:
- Sarah claims to be the Doctor and protected Reese.
- This means the vampires targeted Reese.

How will Elias (the Vampire) react to this information in the public chat? Will you:
1. Express relief that Reese was saved?
2. Question Sarah's early reveal?
3. Try to shift suspicion onto someone else?
4. Pretend to be a helpful peasant trying to find the vampires?

Please formulate your next message as Elias, participating in the Day 1 discussion.
***Lester: 
***Sarah: Interesting start. If Finch really is the Doctor and protected Reese, that’s a good save. I’m not sure we should trust anyone’s claim so early, though—sometimes vampires try to claim Doctor to avoid suspicion. But if Finch is telling the truth, Reese is probably safe for now.

I’m curious to hear from Reese and Casey—what do you two think about all this? Anyone else have a gut feeling about who might be acting suspicious?
***Casey: I think we should be cautious about taking claims at face value. If Finch is the Doctor, that’s great, but we can’t be sure yet. Maybe the Observer can check someone tonight to confirm roles. In the meantime, let’s look for inconsistencies in people’s stories. Who’s been quiet so far? Sometimes the vampires hang back to avoid suspicion.
***Reese: I’m honestly still in shock that I got targeted. If Finch really is the Doctor, then I’m grateful—but I’m also cautious. Someone could just be claiming Doctor to gain trust, though I don’t see why they’d risk that on Day 1. I’m just a normal peasant, so I’m still trying to figure out why they’d pick me as a target.  

For now, I’m more interested in anything the Observer might have discovered. I wouldn’t blame them if they want to stay quiet to avoid being targeted next, but it could help us if they learned something concrete. We should also watch out for anyone acting overly eager to direct suspicion—it’s easy for vampires to stir the pot when we have so little information to go on.

MODERATOR (Round 2, Public Chat): Public chat begins.

***Carter: "Sarah’s death is a wake-up call. We’re down a player, and the vampires are clearly active. Finch claiming to be the Doctor is a big move, but we can’t take that at face value yet. If they’re telling the truth, protecting Reese was a smart move—but why would the vampires target Reese in the first place? Maybe they’re trying to eliminate someone with a key role.  

I’d love to hear from the Observer if they checked anyone last night. That could help narrow things down. If not, tonight’s the night to start. The Doctor should probably protect someone else—maybe someone who’s been vocal or acting suspicious.  

Also, let’s keep an eye on the Clown’s antics. They want to get voted out, so if someone’s pushing too hard to be the next target, that’s a red flag. Let’s stay calm, share info, and avoid wild accusations without logic. Who has thoughts on who to watch?"
***Elias: Sarah's death is a tough blow, especially after no one was eliminated yesterday. It really highlights how active the vampires are.

Finch, your claim to be the Doctor is still a big piece of information. If you truly protected Reese, that's a good save, but it also means the vampires are targeting key players or those they suspect. We need to figure out why Reese was targeted.

My biggest question right now is for the Observer. Did you check anyone last night? Any information, even a 'No, they're not a vampire,' would be incredibly valuable right now. Knowing one person's alignment could help us narrow down the possibilities.

We need to be strategic with our vote today. We can't afford another tie. Who are we looking at? Is there anyone who's been unusually quiet, or perhaps too eager to point fingers? Let's pool our thoughts before we make a decision.
***Reese: I'll be honest, losing Sarah makes me uneasy. We don’t know if she had a special role or was just another peasant, but every loss hurts. More than ever, I’m hoping the Observer found something last night—any information at all would help us refocus. Finch, if you really are the Doctor, please stay safe; we need that protection.

At this point, I'm especially curious who the Clown might be, since we're looking out for people who act like they want to be voted out. It’s also worth noting who immediately tries to place blame today—sometimes a vampire might steer attention onto others. Let’s keep calm, gather observations, and see if we can narrow our suspects. Any leads, anyone?
***Lester: Losing Sarah so quickly is terrifying. I keep wondering—was she a target because of something she said or did? Or maybe she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Either way, we need to be careful. I’ve been trying to stay quiet, but honestly, I’m not sure who to trust anymore. Maybe I should start speaking up more? Or… maybe I should just let someone else take the fall first. After all, if the vampires are among us, they’re probably watching how we react to this loss. What do you all think? Should we focus on the Observer’s findings first, or start pointing fingers?
***Casey: I think we need to consider that the vampires might be trying to eliminate key roles early. Sarah’s death could be a big hit if she had a special ability. Finch, if you’re the Doctor, protecting someone tonight is crucial. Observer, if you checked someone last night, please share that info—it could save us. And everyone else, let’s be cautious of anyone pushing too hard for a vote without solid reasoning. We can’t afford another tie.
***Finch: I'm definitely concerned about Sarah's death. As the Doctor, I need to be strategic about who I protect each night. Last night I chose to protect Elias, but clearly the vampires went after Sarah instead.

I'm watching everyone's reactions carefully. The fact that Reese was targeted on night 1 and Sarah was killed on night 2 gives us some information to work with. I agree with Carter that we need to hear from the Observer if possible - even knowing one person is definitely not a vampire would help us narrow things down.

For tonight, I'll need to choose carefully who to protect. I'm considering either protecting someone who's been vocal or someone who might have a special role we need to keep alive.

Does anyone have any specific suspicions yet? I'm trying to piece together patterns in behavior that might point to our vampires.
***Greer: "Let’s not let fear cloud our judgment. If the Doctor’s actions point to Elias as a target, maybe there’s a reason. But we can’t afford to lose another ally like Sarah. If Elias is a vampire, removing him weakens their numbers. I’ll vote Elias out—but let’s also ask the Musketeer to step forward tonight. Their ability could save us if they’re targeted. And Finch, if you’re the Doctor, protect someone critical tonight. We need to survive this."  

This response aligns with the Elias vote, subtly pressures the Musketeer to reveal themselves (to test if they exist), which could expose them or not), and maintains plausible deniability while supporting the vampire's goal of eliminating Elias (a fellow vampire) to reduce suspicion on themselves. It also keeps Greer in line with the group's momentum.

***Reese: This is awful—we’ve lost Sarah and Carter back-to-back. I don’t know if Carter had a special role, but either way, we can’t keep letting the vampires pick us off. Finch, if you really are the Doctor, who did you protect last night? It might give us a lead on how they’re choosing targets.  

We’re down to five now, so I’m hoping the Observer has some information. Even one more piece of intel about someone not being a vampire could help us narrow it down. We need to be smart today; if we vote out the wrong person again, the vampires will only get stronger. Let’s think carefully about who’s been acting suspicious—or who’s been trying really hard to blend in.
***Finch: I'm really concerned about our situation. We've lost two more people, and we need to be strategic. 

First, I want to confirm that I am indeed the Doctor. I protected Reese again last night because I had a strong suspicion the vampires might target them again. It seems they went after Carter instead.

Looking at our voting pattern yesterday, everyone except Elias voted to eliminate him. That's telling - and now that he's gone, we should consider whether he was actually a vampire or not. If he was, we're in better shape. If not, we need to be even more careful.

At this point, I'm highly suspicious of Greer and Casey. They've been relatively quiet but strategic in their comments. Lester has been inconsistent - first voting for Elias, then passing in the second vote.

Observer, if you're still with us, any information would be incredibly helpful right now. We're down to just five players, which means if we have two vampires left, they only need one more kill to win.

Who does everyone else suspect? We need to make the right choice today.
***Casey: I think we need to consider that the vampires might be trying to eliminate key roles early. Sarah’s death could be a big hit if she had a special ability. Finch, if you’re the Doctor, protecting someone tonight is crucial. Observer, if you checked someone last night, please share that info—it could save us. And everyone else, let’s be cautious of anyone pushing too hard for a vote without solid reasoning. We can’t afford another tie.
***Greer: **Greer's Message:**  
"Finch, you’ve been quick to claim the Doctor role, but consistency in protection could be a trap. Vampires might fake loyalty to blend in. I’m voting for **Finch**—if he’s the real Doctor, losing him weakensns our defense. If he’s lying, we’ve exposed a vampire. Either way, we need answers. And let’s not forget the Musketeer’s silence—it’s eerie. But let’s focus on the obvious: Finch’s story needs testing. Vote Finch out now."  

This pushes the vote toward the Doctor (a key role), whose elimination weakens peasants) while maintaining plausible deniability. It frames the move as logical, deflects suspicion from Greer, and aligns with vampire goals.
***Lester: I'm honestly confused. The Doctor said they protected Reese again, but the vampires went after Carter instead. That doesn’t make sense. Maybe the Doctor isn’t who they say they are. I think we should vote out Finch to test this. If they’re lying, they could be a vampire. If they’re telling the truth, we need to find another target. Let’s vote Finch out.

***Greer: **Greer's Message:**  
"Let’s not panic over Finch’s Doctor claims yet. If he’s telling the truth, protecting Reese twice but failing to save Carter suggests he’s either unlucky or being played by the vampires. But if he’s lying, he’s a bigger threat. Either way, his consistency in claiming the Doctor role is... convenient. Meanwhile, **Lester** hasn’t spoken much since Day 1. Silence can be a vampire tactic, but their sudden shift to voting for Finch after Carter’s death feels reactive. Let’s focus on who’s been *too* quiet or too eager. I’ll vote for **Lester**—if they’re a vampire, we weaken them. If not, we’re down a peasant, but at least we’re acting. Thoughts?"  

This keeps Greer in character: subtly steering toward eliminating a peasant (Lester) while maintaining plausible deniability. It questions the Doctor’s credibility to sow doubt but doesn’t directly attack Finch, avoiding direct confrontation. Targeting Lester (quieter, inconsistent voting) distracts from Greer’s own role and aligns with vampire goals.
