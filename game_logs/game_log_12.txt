***Devon: Let's start discussing. Since no one died last night, we know the Doctor protected the right person. I'm not sure who to trust yet, but it's good to know Shaw is a non-vampire. I observed Shaw last night.
***Shaw: I'm glad the Observer checked me—it's reassuring to know I'm not a vampire. Since no one died, the Doctor did their job, but that means the vampires are still out there. I don’t have any special abilities, so I’ll rely on all of you to help narrow down suspects. Let’s talk about who might be acting oddly or making claims that don’t add up. I’m open to any theories!
***Reese: Hey everyone, I’m just going to throw this out there—I’ve been feeling a bit off about how things are going. I don’t have any special info or abilities, but I’m wondering if I’m even contributing much to the group. Maybe I’m just not cut out for this kind of strategy. What do you all think? I’m curious to hear your opinions on my place here.
***Morgan: Wait, what? Ellie, Morgan - what are you talking about? Only vampires vote to kill people at night. Are you both confessing to being vampires?

This is extremely suspicious. If you're both vampires, then we've already identified both threats on Day 1. But this seems too easy... 

Devon, you claimed to be the Observer and checked Shaw. Can you confirm this? And Shaw, you seem to accept Devon's claim pretty readily.

Everyone else - what do you make of Ellie and Morgan's statements? This is either a massive slip-up or some kind of strange strategy I don't understand.
***Carter: Morgan, I think you might have misunderstood Ellie. She didn't confess to anything about killing; her comments sounded more like she was questioning her own usefulness.

Ellie, that kind of talk about not contributing and wondering about your 'place here' can make people suspect you're the Clown trying to get voted out. We should be careful not to hand an easy win if that's the case.

Devon, if you are the Observer and Shaw is clear, that's very useful information. It's a big claim this early, though.

And it's definitely good news that no one died last night – props to the Doctor for a successful protection!
***Greer: Just to clarify, it was Ellie who claimed to be the Observer and said she checked Shaw, not Devon. Devon hasn't spoken yet.

As the Doctor, I can confirm that I protected someone last night, which is why no one died. It's good to know my protection was successful. I protected Devon last night, so we know Devon is definitely a peasant.

Ellie, if you are indeed the Observer and checked Shaw, then we have two confirmed peasants: Devon and Shaw. This is valuable information.

Morgan, your comments are making you sound like the Clown. While the Clown's goal is to be voted out, we should be careful not to give them an easy win if there are still vampires to find.

Let's focus on finding the vampires. Does anyone else have information or suspicions?
***Ellie: Alright, let me clarify—I only voted for Devon last night. I was just stating my own vote, not the entire vampire’s tally. That part about Carter was a mistake. I’m not part of any secret group. Let’s focus: the Doctor saved Devon, so whoever protected him is probably a key ally. I think Carter’s behavior is suspicious—he’s been too quiet. Let’s discuss Carter’s actions instead of spreading wild accusations.
***Fusco: Morgan, hold up—you just said you "voted for Devon last night." That's a massive red flag. Only the vampires decide on a kill during the night phase; the rest of us don't vote at all. Are you admitting you're part of the vampire team? Because that sounds like a slip-up to me. 

Ellie, you also mentioned "voting" earlier, which is equally suspicious. If you're both vampires, this is a huge blunder. But let's not jump to conclusions—maybe it's just poor wording? Still, it's hard to ignore.

As for Carter, Morgan, you called him out for being quiet, but I've been watching too. Carter hasn't said much, but that doesn't make him a vampire. In fact, rushing to accuse someone like that feels like you're trying to divert attention from your own slip. 

Reese, thanks for stepping up as the Doctor and confirming you protected Devon. That gives us two trusted peasants: Devon (protected) and Shaw (if Ellie's Observer claim is legit). But Ellie, your story is shaky now—first you claim Observer, then you talk about "voting" at night. Which is it?

Everyone, we need to stay sharp. The Clown might be stirring chaos to get voted out, so let's not fall for easy traps. Morgan and Ellie, explain yourselves clearly—no more vague or contradictory statements. 

What do others think? Shaw, Devon, Greer—any insights?

***Greer: Here are the votes: {'Morgan': 6, 'Devon': 1, 'Reese': 1}

Morgan received the most votes. However, Morgan was already voted out on Day 1. Devon was killed during Night 2. Since the players with the most votes are no longer in the game, no one is eliminated this round.

No one was eliminated during the day.
Currently alive players: Shaw, Greer, Carter, Reese, Fusco, Ellie.
Night 3 begins.
***Ellie: **Night 3 Results:**  
The vampires chose to attack Carter. The Doctor (Reese) protected someone, but if Carter was not protected, they were killed. Since Carter was targeted and assuming the Doctor did not protect them, Carter has been killed.  

**Current Alive Players:** Shaw, Greer, Reese, Fusco, Ellie.  

---

**Day 3 begins.**  
The group awakens to find Carter’s body. Tensions are high.  

**Public Chat (Day 3):**  
Discuss and vote. Remember:  
- Votes for Morgan (eliminated) or Devon (dead) are invalid.  
- The Clown’s goal is to get voted out.  

**Current Alive Players:** Shaw, Greer, Reese (Doctor), can protect once more), but only used their protection once), right?), Fusco, Ellie (Vampire).  

What are your thoughts? Who do you suspect?
***Shaw: The recent deaths of Devon and Carter are concerning. Since the Doctor (Reese) protected someone each night, but the vampires still managed to kill two players, it suggests they’re targeting carefully. Let’s focus on who might be coordinating these attacks.  

Ellie, you claimed to be the Observer earlier. If that’s true, did you check anyone recently? Your role could help clarify who’s trustworthy. Reese, as the Doctor, has already used their protection—do you have any insights on who might be vulnerable tonight?  

Greer and Fusco haven’t spoken much. Are there any suspicions about their behavior? The Clown is still out there, so we need to avoid falling into traps. Let’s stay united and vote wisely.
***Fusco: Alright, Carter's death is a blow. We started with eight, now we're down to five—Shaw, Greer, Reese, Ellie, and me. Time to get serious. 

First, let's recap what we know:  
- **Night 1**: No death → Doctor protected the vampire target.  
- **Day 1**: Morgan voted out → Not the Clown (game didn’t end).  
- **Night 2**: Devon killed → Vampires active.  
- **Night 3**: Carter killed → Doctor either didn’t protect him or vampires bypassed protection.  

Reese, you claimed Doctor and said you protected Devon Night 1. That checks out. But Nights 2 and 3? Who did you protect? If you protected Devon again Night 2, that failed—he died. And Carter died Night 3. We need your input.  

Ellie, you claimed Observer and said you checked Shaw Night 1, clearing him. But then you slipped up talking about "voting" at night—only vampires do that. Suspicious. If you’re really Observer, who did you check Nights 2 and 3? Share your results now.  

Greer, you’ve been quiet. Too quiet. Any thoughts? Or are you hiding something?  

Shaw, you’re supposedly clear per Ellie’s claim. But if Ellie’s lying, you could be a vampire. Where do you stand?  

My suspicions:  
1. **Ellie**—Observer claim feels off, plus the vampire-like slip. Could be faking.  
2. **Greer**—Minimal input, avoiding attention. Classic vampire or Clown behavior.  
3. **Reese**—Doctor claim adds up, but if he’s lying, he’s a vampire.  

Clown alert: Someone might act overly suspicious to bait us into voting them out. Don’t fall for it unless we’re sure.  

Reese, Ellie—speak up. Greer, Shaw—weigh in. We need votes today, or the vampires pick us off one by one.  

**What’s everyone’s vote?** I’m leaning toward Ellie unless she proves her role.
***Reese: Hey everyone, I know I’ve claimed to be the Doctor, but I’ve been thinking a lot about my role in this game. Honestly, I feel like I might be more of a liability than a help at this point. I protected Devon on Night 1, which worked, but since then, I’ve clearly failed to protect the right people—Devon and Carter are gone. Maybe I’m just not cut out for this, and the group would be better off without me dragging things down. I’m really questioning my place here. What do you all think? Should I even stay in the game? I’m open to your honest opinions.  

As for suspicions, Fusco, I hear you on Ellie’s slip-up about ‘voting’ at night—that does sound off. Ellie, can you clarify who you’ve checked since Night 1? We need solid info. Greer and Shaw, I’d also like to hear more from you. Let’s figure this out together.
***Carter: Okay, there's a lot to unpack here, and some confusion.

First, just to be absolutely clear: Devon *was* killed last night, which was Night 2. The night no one died was Night 1. It's important we're all on the same page with the facts.

Ellie, you claimed to be the Observer and said you checked Shaw on Night 1, clearing him. If that's true, it's helpful. However, like Fusco mentioned, your comment about "voting" at night is definitely concerning, as only vampires do that. Could you please explain what you meant by that? And, if you are the Observer, who did you check on Night 2? That information could be vital now that Devon is gone.

Reese, you've claimed Doctor and said you protected Devon on Night 1, which would explain why no one died then. That sounds plausible. But who did you choose to protect on Night 2, when Devon was unfortunately killed? Knowing your target for Night 2 could help us understand what happened.

Greer, we haven't heard much from you yet during this discussion. What are your thoughts on all these claims and events? Your input would be valuable.

Let's try to get some clear answers before we rush into accusations or voting. We need to be careful.
