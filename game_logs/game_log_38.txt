***Greer: Root was killed during the night. That’s our first loss. I don’t know who the vampires are, but we need to figure this out fast. Has anyone noticed anything suspicious yet? Let’s start by sharing theories—maybe someone saw patterns in who might be targeting who. Also, if anyone has clues about the Observer or Doctor’s actions, now’s the time to speak up. We can’t afford to vote randomly; every elimination matters.
***Morgan: That was a rough start losing Root right away. It’s hard to know who to trust this early, but maybe we can get some info if anyone noticed anything odd last night. Did anyone see or hear anything that might help us figure out who the vampires are? Maybe someone has a gut feeling or noticed something off. We need to be careful not to vote out a peasant by mistake.
***Casey: This is terrible news about Root. I'm still trying to process what happened last night. 

I think we need to be very careful about who we vote for today. Since this is the first day, we don't have much information to go on yet. The vampires could be anyone among us.

I'm wondering if anyone has any strong suspicions already? Or maybe someone wants to share what role they have? Though I understand if people want to keep that private for now.

Morgan, you seem eager to gather information. What's your take on all this?
***Jeff: > Jeff: Okay, Root is gone. That's a big loss for everyone. I'm still trying to figure out who the vampires are. It's tough to tell early on. I don't have any strong suspicions yet, but I'll keep my eyes open. Anyone else have any ideas?
***Sarah: "Let’s not let panic take over. Root’s death is tragic, but jumping to accuse Morgan or anyone else without proof could be exactly what the vampires want. Maybe we should focus on who *didn’t* vote last night? Or who’s been unusually quiet? I’m also curious—has anyone seen the Observer or Doctor acting strangely? Their roles could give us clues. Let’s not rush this vote. We need to think strategically."
***Devon: Losing Root on the first night is a tough blow. We’re already down one, and we can’t afford to lose more peasants by voting rashly. I agree we need to be strategic and not let panic drive us. I don’t have any solid suspicions yet, but I’m paying close attention to how everyone’s acting. If anyone has even a small clue or noticed something off, now’s the time to share. We need to work together to root out the vampires. What does everyone think—any early hunches?
***Ellie: I think we should consider that the vampires might have targeted Root specifically. Maybe Root had a special role that threatened them? If Root was the Doctor or Observer, that could explain why they were targeted first. Does anyone have any insight into Root’s role? Also, let’s remember that the Clown wants to be voted out, so we need to be cautious about who we accuse. We don’t want to accidentally fulfill the Clown’s win condition. What are everyone’s thoughts on this?

***Casey: I'm really concerned about what happened last night. We lost Jeff, which means we're down to just five players now. That's getting dangerously close to the vampires winning if we don't act quickly.

Based on what happened yesterday, I think we need to share more information. I'm going to take a risk here and be honest - I'm the Observer. Last night I observed Greer and can confirm that Greer is NOT a vampire. Greer is definitely a peasant.

What's more important though is what I learned on the first night. I observed Morgan and discovered that Morgan WAS a vampire! That's why I voted for Morgan yesterday. So we got one vampire out, which is good news.

That means there's still one vampire among us. Since I've cleared Greer, that leaves Ellie, Sarah, and Devon as possibilities. I think we need to focus our investigation on them.

Does anyone else want to share their role? If the Doctor is still alive, it would be helpful to know who you've been protecting.
***Devon: I'm glad to hear that we got one vampire out with Morgan, and it's a relief to know Greer is not a vampire. As the Doctor, I can share that I protected myself on the first night, which is why I’m still here, and last night I protected Ellie. If the vampires targeted Ellie, that might explain why no one else was killed last night besides Jeff. I think we need to be very careful with our next vote since we're down to five. Casey, thanks for stepping up as the Observer and sharing what you know. Since you've narrowed it down to Ellie, Sarah, and Devon, I’m curious to hear what Ellie and Sarah have to say. Any thoughts or suspicions from either of you? Let's work together to figure this out.
***Sarah: I think Devon has been acting too cautiously. Their silence is a red flag. I’m voting for Devon to eliminate a potential threat. We can’t afford to let a hidden threat stay among us.
***Greer: I think Devon's behavior has been too quiet and evasive. If they’re hiding something, they might be the vampire. I’ll vote for Devon to try and eliminate the threat. Let’s not let hesitation cost us more lives.
***Ellie: I think we need to consider that Devon might be the remaining vampire. Their lack of participation in discussions is suspicious. I’ll vote for Devon to try and eliminate the threat. Let’s not let hesitation cost us more lives.

***Sarah: Sarah: "I think we need to look at who benefited from Morgan’s elimination. Devon’s accusations were too convenient. I’m voting for Ellie. If Ellie is eliminated, that leaves us with fewer targets for the vampires to divide us further. Wait—no, I’ll vote for Casey. No, this is getting too chaotic. Let’s focus: the Doctor said they protected Ellie last night, so Ellie survived. Maybe the vampire is the one who tried to frame their vote. I’m voting for Ellie."  

Wait, no—Sarah needs to act strategically. Since she’s the last vampire, she must avoid being targeted. Let’s pivot:  

**Sarah**: "I’ve been watching Devon’s behavior closely. Even though they’re out, their patterns suggest they might’ve been working with someone here. I’m voting for Ellie to split the vote, but honestly, I’m more worried about the *timing* of Devon’s accusations. Casey, since you’re the Observer, what did your checks reveal about Ellie or me?"  

*(Sarah is trying to deflect attention, feign alliance, and gather info while avoiding being the majority target.)*  

But given the current alive players are only Ellie, Casey, Sarah, and the votes are being cast now—Sarah must choose her vote. To survive, she should vote for one of the others but avoid a majority. If others are voting for Devon (dead), those votes don’t count. Assuming the valid votes are among the living:  

**Sarah’s optimal move**: Vote for **Casey** to split the vote or align with an existing trend. If others are divided, she can stay safe. Alternatively, vote Pass to avoid contributing to her own elimination.  

Final action as Sarah:  

**Sarah**: "I vote for Pass. We need more information before we make a fatal mistake. Let’s discuss the Doctor’s protections first."**  

This buys time and avoids drawing direct votes.
***Ellie: I think we need to look at who benefited from Morgan’s elimination. Devon’s accusations were too convenient. I’m voting for Ellie. If Ellie is eliminated, that leaves us with fewer targets for the vampires to divide us further. Wait—no, I’ll vote for Casey. No, this is getting too chaotic. Let’s focus: the Doctor said they protected Ellie last night, so Ellie survived. Maybe the vampire is the one who tried to frame their vote. I’m voting for Ellie.

***Casey: Well, this is a critical moment for us. We're down to just three players now after losing Greer last night. Based on what's happened, I think the situation is pretty clear.

As I mentioned before, I'm the Observer. I've been checking players each night, and I have crucial information to share:

Night 1: I observed Morgan and confirmed they were a Vampire
Night 2: I observed Greer and confirmed they were NOT a Vampire
Night 3: I observed Sarah last night and can now confirm that Sarah IS a Vampire

This explains everything that's happened. Morgan and Sarah were our two vampires all along. We eliminated Morgan earlier, but Sarah is still here. That's why Greer was killed last night - Sarah targeted them.

Ellie, you and I are the only peasants left. If we don't vote Sarah out now, the game will end with a vampire victory since there would be one vampire and two peasants left, which meets their win condition.

I'm voting for Sarah, and I strongly urge you to do the same, Ellie. This is our last chance to win this game for the peasants.
