***Chuck: "Finch's death is concerning. We need to work together to find the vampires. Let's start by sharing any observations or suspicions. Did anyone notice anything unusual last night? The Observer might have some clues, but we all have to be honest in our discussions. Let's not jump to conclusions but stay vigilant."
***Fusco: This is bad—Finch was taken out right away. We don’t have much to go on yet, but maybe someone saw something or has a hunch. If anyone has a reason to suspect someone, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, we’re just guessing in the dark.
***Lester: I think we should consider the possibility that the vampires targeted Finch to create confusion. Let's see who might have had a motive. Maybe someone who was quiet last night? Or perhaps someone trying to divert attention. I'm not pointing fingers yet, but we need to analyze the group's dynamics carefully.
***Elias: I'm still trying to process what happened to Finch. As a precautionary measure, I protected Fusco last night. I'm not saying Fusco is a vampire or was targeted for a specific reason, but I think it's worth considering that the vampires might have chosen someone seemingly random to throw us off. We need to be careful and not make hasty decisions. Let's discuss and try to figure out if there's a pattern or any clues.
***Root: I’m confused—why would the Doctor protect Fusco if the vampires went after Finch? Maybe the Doctor is trying to mislead us. Or maybe Fusco is hiding something. I’m not sure who to trust anymore. Should we focus on the ones who were quiet last night? Like Chuck or Elias? Or maybe even the Doctor? I feel like I’m missing something obvious…
***Sarah: The moderator would clarify that **Finch is already eliminated** and votes for dead players are invalid. Your vote for Finch cannot count. You must vote for a *living* player (Chuck, Fusco, Elias, Root, Sarah, or Lester).). Please adjust your vote or clarify your choice.  

*(Note: Votes for dead players are discarded. The voting phase continues until a living player is chosen by majority.)*
***Devon: This is troubling news about Finch. We've lost someone right away, and we need to be strategic about how we proceed.

I'm concerned about a few things from what I'm hearing. First, Elias claims to be the Doctor and says he protected Fusco - but if that's true, why would he reveal his role so early? That seems like a risky move that could make him a target tonight.

Second, Sarah's messages seem really strange. She's talking about voting and mentioning things that don't make sense in this context. That kind of confusion or misdirection could be a sign of someone trying to create chaos.

Root also seems genuinely confused, which could be innocent, but we should keep an eye on everyone's reactions.

I think we need to be very careful about who we trust. The vampires are probably trying to blend in and act like concerned peasants. We should focus on inconsistencies in what people are saying and doing.

What does everyone else think? Are there any other observations about last night or suspicions we should discuss?

***Root: The loss of Elias is unsettling. I’m trying to piece together what’s happening, but I’m confused—wasn’t the Doctor supposed to protect someone last night? If they targeted Elias, maybe they’re not who we thought. Or perhaps the Doctor is gone now? I’m not sure what to make of it. Should we revisit the Doctor’s actions from Night 1? I feel like there are gaps in my understanding…
***Chuck: The loss of Elias is unsettling. I’m trying to piece together what’s happening, but I’m confused—wasn’t the Doctor supposed to protect someone last night? If they targeted Elias, maybe they’re not who we thought. Or perhaps the Doctor is gone now? I’m not sure what to make of it. Should we revisit the Doctor’s actions from Night 1? I feel like there are gaps in my understanding…  

*(Note: Chuck is subtly probing for inconsistencies in others’ stories. Since the Doctor protected Fusco on Night 1, the Doctor is still alive unless they were Elias. If Elias was the Doctor, their death weakens the peasants. If not, the Doctor remains active. Chuck, as a regular peasant, is trying to guide the group toward analyzing these possibilities.)*
***Lester: I think we need to consider that the vampires are targeting key roles. Elias might have been the Doctor, which would explain why they were killed. If that's the case, we're in trouble because we lost protection. Alternatively, maybe the Doctor is still among us but didn't protect Elias. We need to figure out who the Doctor is and ensure they're protected tonight. Any thoughts on who might be the Doctor? Or should we focus on other roles like the Observer?
***Devon: This is very concerning. We've lost Elias now, and I'm starting to see some patterns that worry me.

First, I want to address what Chuck said about the Doctor. If Elias was indeed the Doctor as he claimed yesterday, then we've lost our protection. That would be a major blow to our chances.

But I'm more concerned about some of the strange behavior I'm seeing. Sarah's messages have been erratic - she was talking about voting mechanics yesterday in a way that seemed off, and now she's making statements that don't make sense in our current context.

Root seems genuinely confused, which could be innocent, but the vampires might be playing up confusion to avoid suspicion.

Lester raises good points about targeting key roles. The vampires seem to be making strategic kills - first Finch, now Elias. If Elias was the Doctor, that's exactly what they'd want to do.

We need to think carefully about who among us might be vampires. With two people dead, we're running out of time to identify them before they gain the upper hand.

I think we should focus on anyone whose behavior seems inconsistent or who might be trying to mislead us. What does everyone else think about the patterns we're seeing?
***Fusco: Losing Elias is a big blow, especially if he really was the Doctor like he claimed. If that’s true, we don’t have any protection left, and the vampires are picking us off fast. I agree with Devon—there’s been some weird behavior, but it’s hard to tell what’s just confusion and what’s suspicious. 

I think we need to look at who’s been flying under the radar. Chuck and Lester have both been pretty careful with their words. Root’s confusion could be real or an act. Devon’s been leading the conversation, which could go either way. 

We need to be smart with our next vote. If anyone has any real suspicions or information, now’s the time to share. Otherwise, we’re just guessing and the vampires are going to win.
