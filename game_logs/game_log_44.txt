***Greer: Devon's death is a shock, but it gives us something to work with. Vampires don't kill randomly—they pick targets that benefit them. Maybe Devon was onto one of them, or perhaps he was set up to frame someone else. I'm leaning toward the latter; it feels too obvious for a first kill. What does everyone else think? We can't afford to pass today—voting someone out might reveal clues, even if it's risky.
***Casey: Devon’s death feels deliberate, but I’m curious—did anyone notice anything unusual before the kill? For example, was there tension between Devon and anyone specific? Also, since the vampires target strategically, maybe they removed someone who was getting too close to their identity. Should we focus on players who’ve been quiet or avoided discussion so far? I’m not sure yet, but I’d caution against jumping to conclusions without evidence. Let’s hear others’ perspectives first.
***Sarah: This is terrible - Devon was killed on the first night before anyone could have been "onto" anything. We need to be more careful.

I think we should focus on the voting patterns once we get there. Right now, we don't have much to go on except that Devon is gone. The vampires made their choice, but without knowing Devon's role, it's hard to say if it was strategic or random.

What concerns me is that some people are already pushing hard for a vote today. We could easily eliminate a valuable peasant role if we're not careful. Maybe we should consider passing this round unless someone says something really suspicious?
***Jeff: I think we should consider that the vampires might have targeted Devon because he was a strong player or had a special role. But since we don't know his role, it's hard to say. Maybe we should look for inconsistencies in people's stories or behavior. For example, if someone claims to have information but can't back it up, that could be a red flag. I'm not sure who to vote for yet, but I think we need to discuss more before deciding. What do others think about the possibility of passing this round?
***Finch: Devon's death is unfortunate, and I agree it’s tough to draw conclusions without knowing his role. I’m wary of passing this round, though—every day we don’t act, the vampires get another chance to strike. We need to start narrowing down suspects, even if it’s based on gut feelings or subtle behavior. Has anyone noticed anything off about how others are reacting to this news? I’m open to hearing more before deciding on a vote.
***Fusco: I agree with Finch that passing gives the vampires another free shot, but we also don’t want to accidentally vote out a special role. Maybe we should ask if anyone has anything to share—sometimes people pick up on things others miss. If nobody has any info, I’d lean toward voting for someone who’s being unusually quiet or evasive. What do you all think?
***Lester: This is a difficult situation. Devon's death on the first night doesn't give us much to work with, but I noticed something concerning about the discussion so far.

Sarah seems very eager to have us pass this round, which strikes me as odd. She's emphasizing caution about eliminating valuable peasant roles, but passing just gives the vampires another free kill tonight. That feels like vampire strategy to me - delay action while they pick us off one by one.

I also find it suspicious that she's downplaying the strategic nature of Devon's death. Vampires usually have reasons for their targets, even on night one.

I think we need to vote today rather than pass. The longer we wait, the worse our odds become. I'm leaning toward voting for Sarah based on her defensive positioning and push for inaction.

What does everyone else think about Sarah's behavior?

***Casey: Finch’s death brings us down to five players. The vampires are clearly active and strategic. We can’t afford to pass again—every delay gives them another chance to eliminate us. Let’s analyze what we know:  

- **Sarah** was voted out on Day 1. Since the game didn’t end, she wasn’t the Clown. She could have been a vampire or a peasant.  
- **Devon** and **Finch** were killed at night. If either had a special role (Observer, Doctor, Musketeer), their absence impacts our strategy.  

Who’s left? **Lester, Greer, Jeff, Fusco, and me.** We need to identify patterns or inconsistencies. For example:  
- Has anyone claimed to have role-related knowledge (e.g., "I know who a vampire is") without proof?  
- Who benefits from inaction? The vampires do, but the Clown might also push for chaos to get voted out.  

I’m wary of **Lester**. On Day 1, he voted for Sarah but now hasn’t spoken much. If he’s a vampire, he might be biding his time. Alternatively, if he’s the Clown, he’s playing it cool. Let’s pressure someone to explain their reasoning or actions. Who’s next?
***Lester: Looking at our situation, we're down to five players and need to be strategic. Two people have died at night - Devon and Finch - and Sarah was voted out yesterday.

I have some information that might help us. I observed Sarah on night 1 and confirmed she was indeed a vampire. So our vote yesterday was correct - we eliminated one of the two vampires.

Last night I observed Jeff and confirmed he's not a vampire, which means he's either a regular peasant or has a special role.

This means among the remaining players - Greer, Casey, and Fusco - one of them is the remaining vampire. We also need to consider that one of us might be the Clown.

Casey, you're being very analytical and pushing for action, which could be genuine peasant behavior or could be a vampire trying to direct suspicion. Your detailed breakdown feels a bit calculated.

Greer and Fusco have been relatively quiet. The remaining vampire might be laying low to avoid detection.

What are everyone's thoughts? Has anyone else noticed anything suspicious about the remaining players?
***Jeff: I think we need to focus on the remaining players and their behavior. Since I was cleared as a non-vampire, let's look at others. Greer and Fusco have been quiet, which could be suspicious. Casey is being very active, which might be a strategy to divert attention. Lester was quiet after voting for Sarah. Maybe we should consider voting for one of the quieter players to test reactions. What does everyone else think?
***Greer: Jeff, your claim as the Observer has a glaring inconsistency that we can't ignore. You said, "Last night I observed Jeff and confirmed he's not a vampire." But you can't observe yourself—the Observer's ability is to investigate other players, not yourself. That's a basic rule. So, either you misspoke, or you're lying about being the Observer to manipulate us. 

If you're lying, you could easily be the remaining vampire, trying to frame me, Casey, or Fusco while painting yourself as "cleared." And let's not forget, you were quick to push the vote onto Sarah yesterday—convenient if you're a vampire eliminating a threat. 

As for me, I'm just a regular peasant, but this feels like a setup. Why are you so eager to narrow the suspects down to three of us? Maybe to distract from your own guilt. I think we should vote for Jeff today—he's the real threat here. 

Fusco, you mentioned being "cleared," but Jeff never cleared you. He only talked about himself and Sarah. That's another red flag. And Casey, you're jumping on Jeff's bandwagon awfully fast—almost like you're coordinating. 

Lester, you've been silent all day. What's your take? We need to act now, or the vampires will pick us off one by one.
***Fusco: Lester, your claim about being the Observer is interesting, but I’m not sure I buy it. You said you “observed Jeff and confirmed he’s not a vampire,” but as Greer pointed out, you can’t observe yourself, and your story seems a bit too convenient. Also, if you really were the Observer, wouldn’t you have shared your info sooner, maybe to save Sarah or help us coordinate better?

Casey, you’re pushing hard for action and trying to direct suspicion, which could be helpful or could be a cover. Jeff, you’re suddenly quiet after being “cleared”—that’s suspicious too.

Honestly, I don’t trust Lester’s story. It feels like he’s trying to control the narrative and frame the rest of us. I think we should consider voting for Lester today. What do the rest of you think?

***Jeff: Greer, Fusco, and I are the last ones standing. Casey was killed last night, which is devastating. Let’s recap:  

- **Sarah** (vampire) was eliminated on Day 1.  
- **Devon** and **Finch** were night kills.  
- **Lester** was voted out on Day 2.  
- **Casey** was killed last night.  

Assuming the Observer is still alive, they might have critical info. If I were the Observer, I’d have investigated someone by now. But since I’m just a peasant, I have to rely on logic.  

Greer and Fusco, what do you know? Have either of you noticed anything suspicious? The remaining vampire is likely among us, and we can’t afford another night. Let’s vote today. Who’s your top suspect?
***Fusco: Well, here we are—the final three. I’ll be honest, I’m suspicious of both of you, but especially Greer. You’ve been pretty defensive and quick to accuse others, and that’s often a vampire move. Jeff, you’ve been quieter, but that could be a strategy too.

At this point, we have to make a decision. If we get it wrong, the game’s over. I want to hear from both of you: why shouldn’t we vote you out right now?
***Greer: This is dire. With only three of us left, one misstep means the vampires win tonight. I'll be honest—I've been holding back information because I didn't want to paint a target on myself, but now it's time to come clean. 

**I'm the Doctor.** Last night, I protected Casey. Clearly, it didn't work—she died anyway. That means one of two things: either the vampires didn't target her (and the kill was faked, which isn't possible), or... someone is lying about their role. Jeff, you claimed to be the Observer, but your story had holes. You said you "observed Jeff" on Night 2—that's impossible. Observers can't investigate themselves. 

Fusco, you've been quiet, but that doesn't clear you. Jeff could be a vampire trying to mislead us, or you could be working together. 

Here's what I propose: vote me out today. If I'm lying about being the Doctor, I deserve it. But if I'm telling the truth, and you eliminate me, the real vampire gets a free kill tonight and wins. Or... if I'm the Clown, well, congratulations—you've played right into my hands. But I'm not. I'm just a desperate Doctor who failed to save Casey. 

Jeff, Fusco—what do you have to say for yourselves? We need answers now.
