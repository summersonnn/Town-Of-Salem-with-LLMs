MODERATOR (Round 1, Public Chat): Public chat begins.

***Reese: Well, that was quick—Finch is already gone. Anyone have any ideas why the vampires would target Finch first? Maybe someone saw something suspicious last night?
***Fusco: > Finch is dead. That was fast. Who would have thought the vampires would go for someone so early on? Maybe they're trying to thin the herd quickly. I wonder if anyone saw anything unusual last night.
***Shaw: "Finch's death is a wake-up call. Last night, the vampires showed they're willing to act fast. I noticed Morgan seemed particularly anxious after
***Jeff: Finch's death is unsettling—they went straight for him Night 1. That tells me the vampires are either targeting strategically or someone's hiding something. Did anyone notice Finch acting unusually yesterday? Or maybe the killers are trying to silence a potential threat early.  

I'm leaning toward discussing patterns: Why Finch? Was he onto someone? Let's share any subtle observations from yesterday—anything off about interactions or votes? No accusations yet, just pooling info.
***Devon: Finch's death is unsettling—they went straight for him Night 1. That tells me the vampires are either targeting strategically or someone's hiding something. Did anyone notice Finch acting unusually yesterday? Or maybe the killers are trying to silence a potential threat early.

I'm leaning toward discussing patterns: Why Finch? Was he onto someone? Let's share any subtle observations from yesterday—anything off about interactions or votes? No accusations yet, just pooling info.
***Morgan: I'm curious—did anyone else notice if Finch was about to accuse someone or had some suspicions before he died? It might help us figure out the vampires' strategy.
***Elias: Honestly, I'm not sure if Finch had shared any strong suspicions or hints. It all happened so fast. I think we need to watch how people behave carefully now—look for inconsistencies in their stories, or overreactions to simple questions. Vampires typically try to mislead or sow confusion, so let's keep our eyes peeled for anyone pressing too hard or getting defensive without much reason.
