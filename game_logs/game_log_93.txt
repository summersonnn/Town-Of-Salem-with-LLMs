***Reese: Hey everyone, it's a shame we lost Finch last night. We need to figure out who might be behind this. Does anyone have any suspicions or information to share? I'm leaning towards Casey, as I noticed some odd behavior from them before night fell. What do you all think?
***Root: This is terrible news about Finch. I'm not sure I agree about Casey though - what odd behavior did you notice, Reese? 

I think we should all share what we know. I'm actually the Observer, and I checked on Greer last night. The moderator confirmed to me that Greer is NOT a vampire. So we can trust Greer for now.
***Sarah: Reese, that's a huge piece of information! If you're truly the Observer and Greer is cleared, that narrows things down significantly. My suspicion about Casey was just a gut feeling, nothing concrete, so I'm happy to reconsider, especially with your new information.

Devon, thanks for sharing your vote. It's interesting that you also suspected Casey. Root, you voted for Finch, who unfortunately was the one killed.

So, if Greer is indeed safe, who else should we be looking at? Reese, did you notice anything else, or have any other hunches?
***Casey: "I'm a bit concerned we're focusing too much on internal accusations already. Finch just died, and we need to prioritize identifying the vampires rather than pointing fingers without evidence. Reese claims to be the Observer and cleared Greer—assuming that's truthful, we still have six others to consider. However, we shouldn’t ignore the possibility of deception. Let’s think strategically: Who had the most reason to target Finch? And why? Maybe we should direct our attention to those who’ve stayed quiet or acted suspiciously during discussions. Let’s not rush a vote until we’ve explored all angles."
***Shaw: That's a very public claim for Day 1, Reese. If you're truly the Observer and Greer is safe, that's one person we can supposedly trust. But it also makes you a huge target. And, we have to consider all possibilities here – someone might be the Clown trying to get voted out by making a bold, perhaps even false, claim. Or it could be a vampire trying to build false trust by "clearing" someone. I agree with Sarah; we need to be very careful and not rush into voting anyone out based on early claims. Why did you decide to come forward with this information so openly, Reese?
***Greer: I appreciate Reese sharing that information—it’s a solid starting point, but I agree with Sarah and Devon that we need to proceed carefully. As someone who was "cleared," I’d remind everyone that my role is just a regular peasant, so I have no special abilities or insights. Let’s focus on cross-checking claims and behaviors. For example, the Clown might be trying to steer attention away from themselves by pushing for quick accusations, while a vampire could be hiding in plain sight. Has anyone noticed inconsistencies in who’s speaking up or staying silent? Let’s dig deeper before we act.
***Devon: This is getting interesting. Root claiming to be the Observer and clearing Greer is a bold move for Day 1. But I notice something odd - Sarah responded to "Reese" about being the Observer, but it was actually Root who made that claim. That's a suspicious mix-up.

Also, Shaw makes a good point about this being a very public claim early on. If Root really is the Observer, they've just painted a target on their back. But it could also be a vampire play to build false trust.

I'm particularly wary of Sarah's confusion about who said what. That kind of mistake could indicate they're not paying close attention, or worse, they might be coordinating with someone and got their stories mixed up.

For now, I think we should be cautious about accepting Root's claim at face value. Casey and Shaw both raised valid concerns about rushing to judgment. What do others think about Sarah's mix-up? That seems like a red flag to me.

***Devon: Wait, hold on everyone. I need to address something important here.

First, there seems to be some confusion about who said what. It was Root who claimed to be the Observer and cleared Greer, not me (Reese). Sarah, you responded to me as if I made that claim, which is concerning.

Second, Root just voted for Greer - the very person they claimed to have cleared as NOT a vampire. That makes absolutely no sense if Root is truly the Observer. Why would you vote to eliminate someone you know is innocent?

This is extremely suspicious behavior. Either Root is lying about being the Observer, or they're the Clown trying to act erratically to get voted out. 

Given this contradiction and Sarah's mix-up, I'm changing my vote. Root's behavior is far more concerning than anything Casey has done.

I change my vote to Root.
***Greer: The contradiction in Root’s actions is glaring—if they were the Observer and cleared me, voting to eliminate me makes no sense. That inconsistency alone should raise red flags. But let’s not forget: the vampires killed Root tonight. Could they have been targeting the Observer? Or was Root lying about their role entirely?  

Reese, you mentioned being the Observer earlier. If that’s true, did you check anyone else yet? The real Observer might still be alive and could help clarify things. I’m not sure who to trust at this point, but Root’s behavior feels like a trap. Let’s focus on who else might be hiding in plain sight. Devon, Shaw—what are your thoughts? You both voted “Pass” yesterday. Any reason to stay quiet now?
***Casey: The contradictions around Root's actions are definitely worth unpacking. If Root *was* the Observer and cleared Greer, voting for Greer would make no sense. But if Root was lying about being the Observer, that could mean they were a vampire trying to mislead us or the Clown trying to create chaos. Either way, their death last night might have been a strategic move by the vampires to eliminate someone who could expose them.  

I also want to highlight that the vampires are clearly active—they’ve killed two nights in a row. We need to focus on protecting ourselves and verifying claims. The real Observer should still be alive, so maybe they can help us narrow things down tonight.  

As for my own thoughts, I’ve been keeping an eye on patterns. Sarah and I were both targeted in yesterday’s vote, and Root’s death adds another layer of confusion. Let’s not rush to accuse anyone else without more evidence, but we should also consider who might be hiding in plain sight. The Clown is still out there, and their goal is to get voted out—so if anyone starts pushing too hard to be eliminated, that’s a red flag.  

Let’s use tonight to gather more information. If the Observer shares who they check next, that could help us eliminate suspects. For now, I’m leaning toward trusting Greer (since Root supposedly cleared them) but staying cautious about others. What do others think?
***Sarah: You're absolutely right, Reese, my apologies. My brain is clearly a bit scrambled with everything going on. It was Root who made that claim, not you. Thanks for the correction.

And that makes Root's actions even more baffling. Claiming to be the Observer, clearing Greer, and then voting for Greer? That's a massive red flag. It either means Root was lying about being the Observer, or they were the Clown trying to get voted out by acting erratically. Either way, their death last night is... convenient for the vampires, if Root was getting close to something, or if Root was the Clown and the vampires just happened to kill them.

Greer, you're right to be confused. If Root was telling the truth about clearing you, then their vote for you is inexplicable.

We've lost two players already, and the confusion around Root's role is only making things harder. We need to figure out who the *real* Observer is, if they're still alive, and what information they might have. Or if Root *was* the Observer, what was their game? What do we do now? Who do we look at next? We can't afford another misstep.
***Shaw: Root's death certainly throws a wrench in things. Their behavior yesterday – claiming Observer, clearing Greer, then voting for Greer – was incredibly contradictory. It makes it hard to trust anything they said, including the supposed clearance of Greer. We should be wary of taking that as fact.

Sarah, you mentioned being 'scrambled,' and while it's a stressful situation, your earlier mix-up about who claimed to be the Observer was quite noticeable. You also received two votes yesterday, tying with Casey for the most. It keeps you on my radar. What were your thoughts leading to Root's death? Did anything Root said or did stand out to you before they were targeted?

The vampires picked off Finch, then Root. We need to figure out their pattern or who they perceive as a threat. Or perhaps who they want to protect by eliminating others. Let's not jump to conclusions, but we need to be critical of all information, especially claims that seem too convenient or contradictory, like Root's.
***Reese: Hey everyone, losing Root last night is a big blow, especially with the confusion around their claim of being the Observer. If they were telling the truth, we’ve lost a key role, but their contradictory behavior—clearing Greer then voting for them—makes me doubt their honesty. It could’ve been a ploy to sow chaos, maybe as the Clown or even a vampire trying to mislead us.

Greer, I’m glad you’re speaking up, but we can’t fully trust Root’s clearance of you yet. We need more solid evidence. Sarah, I appreciate the apology for the mix-up, but it’s still a bit concerning that you misattributed the Observer claim. Mistakes happen, but we have to be sharp.

Shaw, you bring up a good point about patterns. The vampires have taken out Finch and now Root—two vocal players. Maybe they’re targeting those who seem to be leading discussions or posing a threat. We need to be cautious about who we trust and who we point fingers at without evidence.

I’m also curious about Devon and Casey. Devon, you’ve been pretty quiet, and Casey, you tied with Sarah for votes yesterday. Do either of you have thoughts on who might be behind these killings? Let’s keep the discussion open and avoid rushing to conclusions. We can’t afford another misstep.

***Greer: The game is narrowing down, and the stakes are high. Let’s start by clarifying the Observer’s role. Reese, you claimed to be the Observer and confirmed I’m not a vampire. If that’s true, did you check anyone else recently? The real Observer could help us identify threats.  

Casey’s death raises questions. Were they a target? If they were the Musketeer, their elimination doesn’t help us, but if they were a peasant, the vampires are still active. The Doctor might still be alive—did they protect someone last night?  

Shaw and Devon, you’ve both been quiet. Shaw voted for Casey, and Devon voted for Sarah. What are your thoughts on the current situation? Are there any patterns or inconsistencies you’ve noticed?  

We need to be cautious. The Clown is still out there, and the vampires could win if they eliminate one more non-vampire. Let’s focus on verifying claims and cross-checking behaviors. Who do you all suspect, and why?
***Reese: Hey everyone, losing Casey last night is another tough blow. We're down to just four players, and the situation is critical. Greer, to clarify, I never claimed to be the Observer—Root did, on Day 1, and they said they checked you and confirmed you're not a vampire. I’ve been vocal about my suspicions, but I’m just a regular player trying to piece things together.

With only four of us left, the vampires could be very close to winning if there are two of them still alive. We need to be extremely careful. Shaw and Devon, I agree with Greer that we need to hear more from you both. Shaw, you voted for Casey yesterday, and Casey ended up being killed last night. Can you explain your reasoning for that vote? Devon, you’ve been pretty quiet overall—what are your thoughts on who might be a vampire?

I’m looking at the patterns so far. Finch, Root, and now Casey have been killed at night, and Sarah was voted out. Root’s claim about being the Observer and clearing Greer is still unverified, so I’m not fully ready to trust that. We need to focus on any inconsistencies or behaviors that stand out. If the Doctor is still alive, I hope they protected the right person last night, but since someone died, it seems they didn’t.

Let’s discuss openly. I’m suspicious of Shaw right now due to the vote for Casey aligning with the night kill. Shaw, what do you have to say about that? And Devon, please share your thoughts—we can’t afford silence at this stage.
***Shaw: Okay, everyone, this is critical. We're down to four, and we can't afford any more mistakes.

Reese, you're right to ask for clarity, and I'm going to provide it. I am the Observer.
Night 1, I observed Finch. They were a Peasant. The vampires killed Finch.
Night 2, I observed Sarah. Sarah was a Vampire. The village correctly voted Sarah out.
Night 3, last night, I observed Reese. Reese, you are a Vampire.

My vote for Casey yesterday was based on the limited information and suspicions I had at that point. But my observation of you, Reese, last night is concrete evidence. You are the remaining vampire.

Greer, Devon, we need to vote for Reese. If we eliminate Reese, the peasants win. Don't let Reese's attempts to deflect onto me by questioning my past vote distract from this. The evidence from my observations is clear.
***Devon: I need to think carefully here. Shaw just claimed to be the Observer and says they checked Reese last night, finding them to be a vampire. This is a critical moment.

Let me consider what I know:
- Root claimed Observer on Day 1 and said Greer was not a vampire, then voted for Greer (very contradictory)
- Root is now dead
- Shaw is now claiming to be the real Observer
- Shaw says they checked: Finch (peasant, now dead), Sarah (vampire, voted out), and Reese (vampire)
- We're down to 4 players: Me (Devon), Reese, Shaw, and Greer

If Shaw is telling the truth, then Reese is a vampire and we need to vote them out. But if Shaw is lying, they could be the vampire trying to get us to vote out an innocent person.

The fact that Root claimed Observer first but then acted so contradictorily (voting for someone they "cleared") makes Shaw's claim more plausible - Root might have been lying or been the Clown.

Given the critical situation and Shaw's specific claims with a coherent story, I think I should support voting for Reese.

Wait, hold on. Shaw just made a very compelling claim. They're saying they're the real Observer and that they checked:
- Night 1: Finch (peasant) - who died that night
- Night 2: Sarah (vampire) - who we voted out
- Night 3: Reese (vampire)

This actually makes a lot more sense than Root's contradictory behavior. If Shaw is telling the truth, then Root was either lying about being the Observer or was the Clown trying to cause chaos.

Shaw's observations also line up with the voting patterns - Sarah was voted out after Shaw identified them as a vampire.

Greer, this is crucial. We're at 4 players. If there's still a vampire among us and we don't vote them out today, they could win. Shaw's claim is specific and detailed. 

I'm inclined to believe Shaw here. The timeline and observations make sense, and it would explain why Root's behavior was so erratic.

I vote for Reese.
