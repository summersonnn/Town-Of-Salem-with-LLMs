***Elias: "Sarah’s death is a shock, but we can’t let fear control us. I trusted Sarah, so if she was a peasant, that means the vampires are still among us. I’ve noticed Devon acting evasively. Maybe they’re hiding something. Let’s discuss calmly and avoid jumping to conclusions—our goal is to survive together."
***Greer: This is terrible news about Sarah. As we don't know her role, we can't be certain what this means yet. I think we should all share what we know or suspect so far.

I'm a bit suspicious of Jeff actually - something about his silence so far feels off to me. Devon, what's your take on the situation? And Elias, why are you specifically pointing to Devon already?
***Finch: "I'm not pointing fingers at anyone yet. I think we should focus on gathering more information before making accusations. We don't know much about each other's roles or behaviors yet. Let's try to stay calm and discuss this logically."
***Casey: "I'm not sure where to start. Sarah's death leaves a lot of uncertainty. I'm just a Peasant, so I can't offer any special insights, but maybe someone else can? If the Observer checked someone last night, that could rule out a vampire suspect. Or the Doctor might know who was attacked. Let's try to piece this together together."
***Carter: "I think we should consider the possibility that the vampires targeted Sarah because she was a threat to them. Maybe she had a special role like Observer or Doctor. If that's the case, we need to figure out who else might be in danger. I'm not accusing anyone yet, but we should keep a close eye on those who seem too eager to shift blame."
***Jeff: I agree with staying calm, but we need to act strategically. Since Sarah was killed, the Doctor didn’t protect her—so whoever the Doctor is, they might have chosen someone else. Let’s consider who might have had reason to target her. Also, the Observer could’ve checked someone last night. If we can figure out who’s been verified as non-vampire, that might help narrow things down. I’m not sure about Devon or Jeff yet, but let’s keep talking. Maybe someone has more clues?
***Devon: It's tough to know who to trust right now. I didn't notice anything strange about Sarah yesterday, so her being targeted could mean the vampires just picked at random, or maybe they thought she had a special role. 

I agree with Finch and Carter—let's not rush to accuse anyone. If anyone has information, now's the time to share it. Otherwise, maybe we should watch for who tries to steer the conversation too aggressively.
