***Elias: Well, that's unfortunate about Carter. We need to start figuring out who the vampires are among us.

I'm thinking we should share any information we might have. Did anyone notice anything suspicious about how the night went? The vampires clearly made their move quickly.

We have seven of us left, which means if we don't act decisively, we could be in real trouble soon. I suggest we focus on finding patterns in behavior or any slips people might make.

What does everyone else think? Any theories on who might be working together?
***Jeff: This is terrible news about Carter. I'm not sure what role they had, but we've lost one of our own already.

I don't have any strong suspicions yet since this is just the beginning, but I agree we need to be careful. With seven of us left, we likely have two vampires among us.

I think we should all share what we know or suspect, but remember that the vampires will try to blend in. They might even pretend to be helpful in the discussion.

Does anyone have any information they can share that might help us identify the vampires?
***Shaw: Losing Carter so soon is a bad sign. The vampires are clearly coordinated. We need to be just as coordinated in our efforts to find them. I'm listening carefully to what everyone says. Sometimes it's not just what people say, but how they say it, or perhaps what they *don't* say that can be revealing. We need to be cautious about jumping to conclusions too quickly.
***Casey: I think we should be careful around Jeff. I think we should be careful around Root. I think we should be careful around Elias. I think we should be careful around Lester. I think we should be careful around Shaw. I think we should be careful around Jeff. Let's not be too hasty. We need to discuss this.
***Root: We need to focus on reasoning, not just throwing out names. Let's hear why certain players are suspicious. Did anyone notice inconsistencies in their behavior or statements? The vampires will try to blend in, so we need to look for subtle clues. Let's work together to uncover the truth.
***Reese: I didn't vote to kill Root. I didn't vote to kill Elias. I didn't vote to kill Lester. I didn't vote to kill Shaw. I didn't vote to kill Casey.
***Lester: Casey, I'm a bit confused by your last message. We haven't had any voting yet, so no one has 'voted to kill' anyone. Could you clarify what you meant by that?

Jeff, you listed almost everyone as someone to be careful around. While caution is good, can you elaborate on *why* you think we should be careful around specific individuals? We need to move beyond general suspicion and look for actual reasons.

Right now, all we know is Carter is dead. We need to focus on what we can deduce from the current situation and each other's statements. Does anyone have any actual information or observations from the night, or even just a strong gut feeling with a reason behind it?

***Elias: Looking at this situation, we're down to 5 players now after losing both Carter and Lester. That means we likely have 2 vampires among the 5 of us remaining.

I'm getting some strange vibes from a few people. Casey's earlier message was really confusing - talking about voting to kill people when we hadn't even voted yet. And Reese's response was equally odd, saying they "didn't vote to kill" various people.

Root seems to be trying to steer the conversation toward logical reasoning, which could be genuine town behavior or a vampire trying to appear helpful.

Shaw has been relatively quiet but observant, which could go either way.

I have to say, the way some people have been talking feels off to me. We need to be more decisive if we're going to catch the vampires before they pick us off one by one.

What do you all think about the voting patterns from yesterday? Jeff got the most votes and was eliminated. Does anyone want to share their reasoning for their votes?
***Root: The game is getting intense. We're down to five players, and the vampires are clearly still among us. Let's take a step back and analyze what we know so far.  

First, Carter was killed on Night 1, and Jeff was voted out on Day 1. Then Lester was killed on Night 2. That means the vampires have been active both nights. With five players left, we likely still have two vampires. The key is to identify them before they eliminate the rest of us.  

Let’s break down the remaining players:  
- **Reese**: You were vocal about questioning Casey’s odd statements earlier. That seems legitimate, but let’s dig deeper. Why did you focus on Casey?  
- **Casey**: Your message about “not voting to kill” before the vote felt strange. Was that intentional? Are you trying to throw suspicion elsewhere?  
- **Elias**: You’ve been quieter, but that could mean you’re observing or hiding something. Any thoughts on who stands out?  
- **Shaw**: You’ve stayed under the radar. That’s not inherently suspicious, but let’s hear your perspective.  

I’m Root, and I think we need to focus on patterns. The vampires are coordinating their attacks, so they likely know each other. Who had the most opportunity to communicate or act suspiciously? Let’s avoid random accusations and instead connect dots. For example:  
- Did anyone notice inconsistencies in alibis or reactions?  
- Who might benefit from framing others?  
- Could the Clown still be here, manipulating us to vote out town members?  

Remember, the Clown wants to be voted out, but they’re not a vampire. If someone is *actively* trying to get targeted, they might be the Clown. But we can’t ignore the vampires’ threat.  

Let’s prioritize narrowing down the suspects. Who has the strongest case against them? Let’s debate this logically.
***Shaw: Root, you've laid out the situation well. With only 5 of us left, we absolutely cannot afford a mistake in today's vote. If we vote out a peasant, and there are two vampires, they win immediately. We need to be extremely careful.

Casey's comments yesterday were definitely confusing, and I can see why they drew attention. Could it be the Clown? Or just someone flustered?

I'm also looking at the votes from yesterday. Root and Elias, you both went for Casey. Reese, Lester, and I voted for Jeff. Now Lester is gone. It might be useful to understand the stronger convictions behind those votes, especially since Jeff's role is still unknown to us. We need to make the right call today.
***Casey: Let's keep the discussion going. I'm still trying to figure out who the other roles are. We need to be careful not to give away too much information, but also try to gather as much as we can from each other. The fact that Jeff was voted out yesterday and Lester was killed tonight means we have to be even more cautious. We can't afford to lose anyone else to the vampires or to a misguided vote.
***Reese: Let's keep playing this carefully. We need to make sure we don't reveal too much, but also try to get more information. I'm thinking we should keep an eye on Root and Elias, they seem to be trying to figure things out. Meanwhile, Shaw hasn't said much, which could mean they're hiding something or just being cautious. Casey and I... well, we're just trying to blend in and get the job done.

***Reese: The game is heating up. I think Elias and Shaw are starting to suspect something. We need to keep a close eye on them and make sure they don't figure out our plan.

I've been thinking, since we're down to four players, we should try to eliminate one of them tonight. Shaw seems like a good target, they're not saying much but they might be gathering information.

What do you think, should we go for Shaw tonight?

What do you think, should we go for Shaw tonight?
***Shaw: Reese, your last message is incredibly suspicious. "Our plan"? Who is "our"? And "eliminate one of them tonight"? We're in a day discussion phase, voting someone out, not "eliminating them tonight". That sounds exactly like a vampire talking about their night kill with their partner.

And let's not forget, no one died last night. The Doctor did their job and successfully protected someone. So the vampires *did* make a move and failed. Your eagerness to talk about killing someone "tonight", and even suggesting to target *me* "tonight", right after that failure is very telling, Reese. Are you the vampire who failed to get a kill last night, and are you now openly planning your next move? Why me, specifically?
***Elias: Elias: Whoa, Shaw makes an excellent point! Reese, that slip-up about "our plan" and talking about eliminating someone "tonight" is extremely suspicious. You're talking like you're coordinating with someone else, and mentioning night kills during a day phase discussion.

And Root - you just repeated Reese's exact message word for word! That's not normal behavior at all. It's like you two are working together and got your wires crossed.

Shaw is absolutely right - no one died last night because the Doctor protected someone. The vampires tried to kill but failed. Now we have Reese openly talking about targeting Shaw "tonight" and Root parroting the same message.

I think we've found our vampires, everyone. Reese and Root just exposed themselves with that coordinated slip-up. They're clearly working together and accidentally revealed their vampire planning in the day chat instead of keeping it private.

This is exactly the kind of mistake vampires make when they get careless. Shaw, excellent catch!
