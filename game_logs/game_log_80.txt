MODERATOR (Round 1, Public Chat): Public chat begins.

***Finch: Reese was killed last night. We need to figure out who the vampires are before they strike again. Does anyone have any information or observations they can share? Let's discuss who might be suspicious and why.
***Lester: Reese is gone. That's a shame. I'm not sure what to make of it yet, honestly. It's hard to know if it was a strategic kill or just random. I'm just trying to listen to what everyone else has to say. Does anyone have a strong feeling about anything?
***Ellie: I'm glad I protected Chuck last night. Hopefully, that was the right call. Does anyone have any theories about who might be a vampire?
***Elias: I think we should consider voting out someone who hasn't been very active in the discussion. Maybe Lester? He hasn't said much so far. What do you all think?
***Carter: Reese's death is troubling, but it's too early to jump to conclusions. Ellie, you claim you're the Doctor and protected Chuck—why did you choose him specifically? That seems like an odd first-night pick with no information. 

Finch, pushing to vote out Lester for being quiet feels premature. Lester, care to share your thoughts? Inactivity could mean anything—nervousness, strategy, or just processing. 

Everyone, let's slow down. We need more discussion before voting blindly. Vampires benefit from rushed decisions. I suggest we:
1. Share any subtle observations from yesterday
2. Discuss who might be avoiding certain topics
3. Consider why Reese was targeted—was it random or strategic?

No votes yet. More voices needed.
***Devon: The Doctor’s claim raises questions—protecting Chuck without prior discussion seems risky. If Ellie is genuine, that means Chuck survived last night’s attack, but why would vampires target Reese randomly? Maybe we should ask the Observer if they checked anyone last night? Also, Lester’s silence could be strategic, but inactivity often hides something. Let’s not rush the vote—dig deeper first. Who here thinks they’ve noticed something off?
***Chuck: Ellie, that's a bold claim. If you really are the Doctor, you just made yourself a target for the vampires tonight. Why did you pick me to protect? I didn't do anything suspicious (at least, I don't think I did). 

Elias, voting out someone for being quiet on the first day is risky. Sometimes people just need a minute to get their bearings. 

I agree with Carter and Devon—let's not rush. If anyone has real info, now's the time to share. Otherwise, we risk helping the vampires by making a random vote.
