***Greer: It's really unsettling that Morgan was killed first—I wonder if the vampires saw them as a threat or if it was just random. Since we have no information yet, maybe we should share any small observations from yesterday? Like who Morgan interacted with or if anyone seemed off. I'm also thinking we need to be careful not to rush into voting someone out without clues, especially with the Clown around. If we accidentally vote for them, the game ends, and we all lose. Anyone else have thoughts?
***Ellie: I think we should be cautious about revealing too much too soon.
***Carter: This is a terrible start to our village. Morgan was a good person, I'm sure. I've been thinking about this all night - the vampires must have had a reason to target Morgan first. Maybe Morgan seemed like they might be the Observer? 

I'm a bit suspicious of Ellie already, to be honest. That comment about "not revealing too much" feels like something a vampire would say to keep information limited. What exactly are you afraid of revealing, Ellie?

I think we should all share what roles we claim to be. I'll go first - I'm just a regular peasant. Nothing special about me at all.
***Casey: Ellie, I don't think accusing people without evidence is helpful. Let's focus on the facts. Morgan was killed, which means the vampires are active. As a regular peasant, I don't have any special info, but maybe others do? 

I think we should hear from everyone before jumping to conclusions. Carter, what's your take on this? And Greer, you've been quiet—anything to add? 

Also, remember the Clown wants us to vote them out. So if someone is pushing too hard to be voted, that's a red flag. Let's not give the Clown an easy win.
***Finch: I’m not entirely convinced Ellie’s comment alone makes her suspicious. In fact, it might just be a natural response not to over-share. We’re all a bit on edge, right? But Carter raises a good point: Morgan might have been taken out because the vampires suspected something about them—maybe a special role. We can’t be sure yet.

At this point, we should keep our eyes open for inconsistencies in people’s claims or behaviors. If someone was the Observer, they might have some intel (though they might not want to reveal themselves too soon). For now, I’m looking out for anyone who seems overly desperate to lead the conversation or push a vote too fast. That’s more suspicious to me than someone saying “let’s not share too much.” 

Lester and Casey, what do you two think? I’ve barely heard from you. Any hunches or observations?
***Elias: The fact that Morgan was targeted first is definitely key here. Since I know Carter is a regular peasant, his comments aren’t coming from a special role’s perspective—which means we can’t rely on him having hidden knowledge. That said, Ellie’s hesitation might just be nerves. Let’s not jump to conclusions. 

What’s more concerning: Morgan’s death suggests the vampires are testing us already. We need to figure out who has protective roles (like the Doctor) to shield them. I’d suggest we prioritize keeping the Doctor alive if we can identify them. Also, let’s not rush into voting unless someone’s behavior is *extremely* suspicious. The Clown’s out there, and they’ll want us to panic into voting them out accidentally. Let’s stay calm. 

Finch, you’ve been quiet too—any thoughts? And what about you, Elias? You’ve been pretty reserved so far.
***Lester: I'm just a regular peasant, Lester. Nothing to hide here. Morgan's death is a tragedy, but it's also a learning opportunity. We need to stay vigilant and not let the Clown steer us off course. 

I'm not sure about Ellie's comment, but I think we should focus on the bigger picture. The vampires are out there, and they're ruthless. We need to identify them before they strike again. 

Any other thoughts? We're down to seven players now, and the stakes are higher than ever. Let's not let our guard down.

***Greer: It's devastating that Lester was killed last night. We're down to just five of us now, and we need to be extremely careful. 

Looking back at yesterday, I find it interesting that Carter and Elias were the ones who pushed hardest to vote out Ellie. Carter, you immediately accused her of being suspicious for suggesting caution, and Elias, you doubled down with that second vote. Now Ellie's gone, and we have no idea if she was a vampire, a peasant, or even the Clown. 

But what's more alarming is that Lester—who Ellie voted for yesterday—was killed by the vampires. That feels intentional. Are the vampires trying to make it look like Ellie was onto something? Or is this a setup to frame Carter and Elias by making them seem "right" about Ellie? 

Carter and Elias, I need you to explain your reasoning from yesterday more clearly. Why were you so convinced about Ellie? And what do you make of Lester's death now? 

Finch and Casey, you both passed yesterday. Do you have any new insights? We can't afford to stay silent—the vampires are thinning our ranks fast. 

Also, let's not forget the Clown is still out there. If anyone starts acting overly eager to be voted out, that's a huge red flag. We need unity to find the real threats.
***Finch: I’m honestly rattled by losing Lester right after Ellie got voted out. It feels like someone’s trying to trace these killings back to the voting patterns, but I can’t figure out who stands to gain from it. The two biggest question marks for me right now are Carter and Elias, since they were pretty vocal yesterday. 

That said, I don’t want to fixate on just them; it could be a setup. Maybe someone else saw a convenient way to make them look suspicious. Right now, I don’t have concrete proof to point fingers confidently. But I do agree with Greer—Carter and Elias, can you explain why you went after Ellie so hard? Maybe it really was a hunch, or maybe there’s something more you’re not sharing. 

Casey, you’ve been pretty quiet overall, which also makes me curious about your thoughts. Has anything shifted your perspective after Lester’s death? It’s getting tense, and we can’t afford to make a mistake.
***Elias: "Greer, I understand your frustration, but let’s not let panic cloud our judgment. I voted for Ellie because she seemed overly defensive about her ‘caution’—like she was hiding something. But now that Lester’s dead, I’m realizing how easily we could’ve been manipulated. The vampires want us divided. Carter and I were acting on instinct, and we were wrong. That’s on us. But now, let’s focus on the *current* threats. 

Casey and Finch have been eerily quiet. Casey hasn’t spoken much, and Finch… well, Finch’s silence is almost *too* calculated. Meanwhile, you, Greer—you’re pushing hard to pin this on Carter and me. Why? Are you trying to deflect suspicion from yourself? 

The real question is: Who benefits from Ellie’s elimination? If the vampires killed Lester *after* Ellie was gone, maybe they’re trying to make us think the vote worked. But we’re still losing. Let’s not repeat the same mistakes. I say we vote for Finch tonight. Their silence speaks volumes."
***Casey: I think we need to slow down here. Accusing people without solid evidence is exactly what the vampires want. Let's recap: Morgan was killed first, then Ellie was voted out, and now Lester is dead. The pattern here isn't clear, but the vampires are definitely trying to destabilize us. 

Greer, you're right to question Carter and Elias's motives, but let's not forget that the Clown is still among us. If we start turning on each other, we risk losing to the Clown's win condition. 

As for me, I've been quiet because I'm trying to observe and not jump to conclusions. But I will say this: I protected Carter both nights. If Carter had been the target, we'd know by now. That might mean the vampires are avoiding him, or maybe they just haven't targeted him yet. 

Elias, your sudden shift to accusing Finch feels rushed. What makes you think Finch is the threat now? And Carter, your initial push against Ellie needs more explanation. Let's get clarity before we act. 

We need a strategy, not just reactive accusations. Who has ideas on how to systematically uncover the vampires without playing into the Clown's hands?
***Carter: I need to be careful here. As the Clown, my goal is to get voted out, but I can't be too obvious about it. I should try to appear suspicious enough that people vote for me, but not so suspicious that they think I'm the Clown.

Carter: I appreciate everyone's concerns, but I think we're getting distracted from the real issue. Yes, I voted for Ellie - I thought her comment about not revealing too much was suspicious. Maybe I was wrong, but I was just trying to protect our village.

Casey, you say you protected me both nights? That's interesting because I didn't feel any different. Are you claiming to be the Doctor? If so, that's a bold claim to make publicly. The vampires will surely target you next if that's true.

I'm more concerned about Finch and Greer right now. Finch has been very quiet, and Greer seems to be trying to turn everyone against me and Elias. Classic vampire tactic - create division among the peasants.

Look, I'm just a regular peasant trying to survive here. I don't have any special abilities to help us, but I do think we need to be more strategic. Maybe we should focus on who's been the most evasive so far? Or who seems to be pushing narratives that divide us rather than unite us?

I'm willing to vote for whoever the group thinks is most suspicious, but right now, I'm leaning toward Finch. Their silence is concerning.
