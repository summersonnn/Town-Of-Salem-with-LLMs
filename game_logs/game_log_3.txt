***Casey: Greer was killed tonight, that's really unfortunate. We need to figure out who the vampires are quickly. Does anyone have any information or insights to share?
***Reese: I agree, losing Greer so early is concerning. Since the vampires struck first, we need to be cautious about who we trust. I wonder if anyone noticed strange behavior last night? Also, we should consider who might have special roles—like the Observer or Doctor—who could be working behind the scenes to help us. Let’s keep an eye out for patterns in who might be targeted next.
***Fusco: Well, losing Greer right off the bat is tough. We're down to 7 players now, which means we've got 2 vampires among us and need to be smart about this.

I'm thinking the vampires might have gone after Greer randomly since it was the first night - no real patterns to work with yet. But going forward, we should definitely watch who's pushing too hard to vote people out or who's being suspiciously quiet.

Has anyone noticed anything odd? I know it's early, but every bit of information helps. And yeah, Reese makes a good point - if we have an Observer out there, they should be gathering intel carefully without exposing themselves too early.
***Jeff: 
***Finch: Alright, so Greer was killed last night. That's a big loss. I think we need to start looking for clues. Maybe someone noticed something suspicious? Let's see... Reese mentioned the Observer and Doctor roles. I wonder if the Observer got any info last night. If they did, they might not want to reveal themselves yet. 

Also, the Doctor could have protected someone. Since Greer was killed, maybe the Doctor didn't protect them. But it's possible the Doctor protected someone else, and the vampires targeted Greer. 

I think we should start discussing possible suspects. Who do you think might be a vampire? Let's not jump to conclusions, but share any observations. 

Carter, what's your take on this? You've been quiet so far. Reese, you mentioned the Observer—do you think they'll come forward with info? 

We need to be careful not to accuse without evidence, but also not let the vampires manipulate the discussion. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can uncover something. 

Also, remember the Clown's win condition. If someone is trying too hard to get voted out, they might be the Clown. But the Clown can't reveal their role, so it's tricky. 

Let's focus on the vampires first. Any ideas?
***Morgan: co voted Reese. He sees Jeff claim to vote Greer (my vote). Fusco knows Jeff is a peasant lying.

So FinchOkay, this is a lot to take in. Jeff, you're saying you voted to kill Greer. Fusco, you're saying you voted to kill Reese. We know Greer was the one who died.

So, if you're *both* telling the truth about your votes, you've basically just announced yourselves as the two vampires. That's a very bold strategy for day one, if true.

But it seems more likely that one of you is not telling the whole truth, or perhaps trying to get us to vote for them. Why would a peasant claim to have made a vampire kill vote? That's either a very risky move to try and frame someone, or... could it be the Clown trying
***Carter: Exactly! That's the thought that immediately came to my mind. Why would anyone, especially a peasant, claim to have 'voted' for the night kill? It makes no sense unless they're either a vampire trying to be overly clever, or... they're trying to get themselves eliminated. And if it's the latter, then we're dealing with the Clown.

It's a tricky situation because we don't want to just hand them the win, but we also can't ignore such blatant attempts to draw attention. So, Jeff, Fusco, your claims are very, very suspicious. It almost feels like someone is *trying* to get us to vote for them. And honestly, that kind of behavior, whether it's from a vampire or someone else, is exactly what we need to be looking at closely. It's confusing, and confusion benefits the vampires... or the Clown.

***Reese: Jeff was killed last night, bringing us down to six players. With two vampires still among us, we need to be even more cautious. Let’s revisit the Day 1 votes—Jeff and Fusco both made bold claims about their votes, which led to a tie. Now that Jeff is dead, does that make Fusco a suspect? Or was Jeff a vampire trying to mislead us?  

Also, remember the Doctor’s role—someone was protected both nights. If the vampires targeted Jeff intentionally, maybe they thought he was a threat. But if he was a peasant, his death weakens our numbers. Let’s stay alert for anyone pushing to eliminate key players or acting inconsistently.  

Who do you think we should focus on next?
***Fusco: Two players dead already - Greer and Jeff. That leaves six of us, and with two vampires still out there, we're getting close to a dangerous ratio.

I'm looking back at yesterday's chaos. Jeff claimed he voted to kill Greer, which made no sense for a peasant to say. Now he's dead. Either the vampires took him out because his bizarre claim made him seem like the Clown (and they didn't want us accidentally voting him out and losing), or maybe he actually was onto something and they silenced him.

Fusco also made a similar claim yesterday about voting to kill Reese. That's equally suspicious. Two people can't both be making vampire kill votes unless they're both vampires, which seems unlikely they'd both out themselves.

I'm starting to think one of them might have been the Clown trying to get voted out with that weird behavior. But now Jeff's dead, so if he was the Clown, that's one less thing to worry about.

Reese, you make a good point about the Doctor. Someone's been protected both nights. The fact that only one person died each night despite two vampires suggests our Doctor is doing their job.

I'm keeping my eye on those who pushed hard for specific votes yesterday - particularly those who voted for Jeff. Casey and Reese both voted for Jeff. Was that because they saw through his act, or were they vampires eliminating someone who was acting too suspiciously?
***Finch: I think we should focus on Fusco next. His behavior has been erratic, and he might be trying to distract us. Let’s see how he reacts today.
***Carter: Okay, so Jeff is dead, and his strange 'vote' claim from yesterday is now moot. But Fusco's similar claim still stands. I think we need to really dig into that. Why would someone say they 'voted' for a night kill? It's not how it works. It makes me wonder if he's trying to confuse us, or maybe even trying to get himself voted out by acting so strangely. It's a very odd strategy for a peasant, wouldn't you agree? So, if he's not a vampire, what else could he be? We need to consider all possibilities here, and his actions are definitely raising red flags for me. I'm leaning towards him being our primary suspect right now.
***Casey: I'm still trying to process everything that's happened. Jeff's death is concerning, and I'm not sure what to make of Fusco's earlier claim. It seems suspicious, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. Let's keep discussing and see if we can figure out what's going on.
***Morgan: Fusco's self-analysis is... interesting. He's basically making the case against himself, which is exactly what someone trying to get voted out might do. If he's the Clown, voting for him is an instant loss for us peasants and vampires. We really need to consider that. Jeff made a similar odd claim and the vampires got him – maybe they thought he was the Clown and didn't want him to win by getting voted out?

And Reese, just a quick clarification on the Doctor: the moderator said if the Doctor protects the target, it's announced that 'no one died.' Since someone has died each night, the Doctor unfortunately hasn't been successful in protecting the actual target yet. We can't rely on the assumption that they've been successfully protecting someone from the vampires.

So, while Fusco's behavior is screaming 'look at me,' is it a genuine threat, or a Clown's trap? What do others think? Are there other behaviors we should be looking at?
