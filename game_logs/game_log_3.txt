***Finch: Good morning everyone. I'm sorry to hear about Carter. It's always difficult to lose someone on the first night.

Since I don't have any special abilities as a peasant, I'll need to rely on logic and observation. Does anyone have any information they'd like to share that might help us identify the vampires?

I think it's important we start gathering information. If there's an Observer among us, they might have learned something useful last night, though I understand if they want to keep their identity hidden for now.
***Shaw: Okay, that's a fair start. Losing Carter right away is rough.

I'm just a regular peasant too, so I'm in the same boat as you, Shaw. We need to be careful about who we trust.

Did anyone notice anything odd last night? Or perhaps someone has a gut feeling? Sometimes those can be surprisingly accurate, though we shouldn't rely on them alone.
***Sarah: I'm just thinking out loud here, but if there's a Doctor or an Observer among us, they might have some insight into what happened last night. Maybe they can share something without revealing too much about their roles?
***Ellie: Good morning. I'm Ellie. I'm just a regular peasant with no special abilities, so I'll need to rely on discussion and logic to figure this out. 

I'm curious - does anyone have any observations or theories about who might be a vampire? I think it could be helpful if anyone has information from their abilities, like the Observer or Doctor, but I understand if they want to keep their role secret for safety. 

Also, we should keep in mind the presence of the Clown. They want to be voted out, but they can't reveal their role directly. We'll need to be careful not to accidentally eliminate them before dealing with the vampires. 

What are everyone's thoughts on how to approach today's discussion?
***Jeff: I'm Jeff. I agree with Shaw and Ellie—this is tricky without more info. Since Carter was killed, we know vampires are active. If there's a Doctor, they might know who the vampires targeted, but again, they might not want to reveal their role yet. 

I’ll add that we should be cautious about who we accuse. The Clown could be trying to mislead us, and the Musketeer’s ability is a wildcard if we push for a vote too soon. Maybe we focus on cross-checking stories or look for patterns in who’s speaking up or staying quiet? 

For example, if someone suddenly changes their narrative or avoids questions, that could be a red flag. But we need to avoid jumping to conclusions without evidence. Thoughts?
***Chuck: Good points, Jeff. It's crucial we don't rush into accusations. We've lost Carter, and the vampires are clearly organized. We need to be smart about this.

I agree with the idea of looking for patterns or inconsistencies. Sometimes what people *don't* say can be as telling as what they do. Has anyone noticed anyone being unusually quiet, or perhaps trying to steer the conversation in a particular direction?

It's tough, but we have to start somewhere. If anyone has even a small piece of information, or a suspicion, now is the time to bring it up, even if it's just a feeling. We can discuss it as a group.
***Morgan: I think we should consider the possibility that the vampires might have targeted Carter to create confusion. Since Carter was a regular peasant, maybe they wanted to reduce our numbers without giving us much information. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on who might have been involved in the attack? Or perhaps someone noticed something unusual about another player's behavior before the night phase? 

I also want to remind everyone that the Clown is still among us, and their goal is to be voted out. We need to be careful not to let them manipulate the discussion to achieve their objective. 

Maybe we can start by sharing our own alibis or what we were doing during the night, even though as regular peasants, we don't have night actions. It might help to build trust within the group. 

What do you all think? Should we proceed with sharing our "alibis" or focus on other strategies?
***Elias: Sarah: "Wait, Elias, I’m confused. The night’s decision was made by the vampires, so your admission could be a clue. But let’s not get sidetracked. Does anyone have any *daytime* observations or alibis? Who here seems too eager to talk about the night’s actions?"  

This response calls attention to Elias’s boldness while steering the conversation toward broader suspicion and encouraging others to share their perspectives, keeping the discussion focused on identifying the vampires rather than letting Elias control the narrative.
