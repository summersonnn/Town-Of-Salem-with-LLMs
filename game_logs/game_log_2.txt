***Reese: Wow, that was fast—Chuck is gone already. Anyone have any ideas or suspicions? Did anyone notice anything odd last night or want to share any theories?
***Devon: Ellie: Wow, Chuck already? That's rough. I'm just trying to process this. No immediate suspicions from my end, but I'm listening to everyone.

Reese: This is exactly what the vampires want - chaos. We need to stay calm. My first thought is, who *didn't* speak up immediately? Or who seems too eager to point fingers? I'm watching everyone.

Sarah: I agree with Reese, we need to be careful. It's too early to accuse anyone without information. Did anyone have any strange interactions last night, or notice anything unusual before Chuck was killed?
***Finch: That's a good point, Sarah. I didn't notice anything specific with Chuck before nightfall—everything seemed normal in the brief intro. But Reese is right about avoiding chaos. Jumping to accusations now could help the vampires divide us. 

Since we have no concrete leads, maybe we should focus on who seems overly quiet or rehearsed? Or conversely, who's pushing too hard for an early vote? I'm leaning toward passing today unless someone has a strong reason to suspect a player. A misvote could hurt us more than waiting for more info. What does everyone else think?
***Greer: I’m with the idea of holding off on a vote today unless we’ve got something solid. Chuck’s death is a blow, but we’ve got no real clues yet. Rushing into accusations could play right into the vampires’ hands. I’m curious, though—does anyone feel like they’ve picked up on any odd behavior or vibes from last night or even just now? I’m all ears.
***Sarah: I agree with holding off on a vote today. Let’s focus on gathering info. The observer is out there, so we need to be careful about what we share openly. I’ve been paying attention to body language and inconsistencies—has anyone noticed anything subtle that stands out? Also, let’s avoid giving the observer a reason to single us out. Vampires won’t attack randomly, but they’ll exploit our mistakes. Stay sharp.
***Ellie: I'm really shocked about Chuck. I didn't notice anything unusual last night, but it's concerning how quickly the vampires acted.

I think we should be careful about rushing to vote someone out today without solid evidence. We're all still getting to know each other, and making a wrong accusation could help the vampires more than it helps us.

Since we're discussing strategy, I want to remind everyone that we have special roles among us that can help. The Observer can identify vampires, the Doctor can protect potential targets, and the Musketeer has that final shot if they're voted out. We need to use these advantages wisely.

For now, I'm just going to observe everyone's behavior and contributions. I don't have enough information to make an accusation yet, but I'm paying close attention.
***Shaw: I’m with everyone on taking it slow today. Chuck’s death has me on edge, but without any clear signs or stories from last night, accusing anyone now feels like a gamble we can’t afford. Let’s keep the discussion open and see if anything shakes loose as we talk more. Anyone else feeling the same way?

***Finch: Okay, Ellie's death last night is a huge blow—two peasants gone already, and we're no closer to finding the vampires. We need to get serious today because if we don't make progress, they'll just pick us off one by one.

First, let's recap Day 1: most of us voted to pass, which made sense with no info. But two people didn't—Devon voted for me (Finch) out of nowhere, and Shaw voted for Ellie. Now, Ellie's dead, confirming she was innocent. That means Shaw's vote looks less suspicious since vampires wouldn't kill one of their own, so voting for Ellie could've just been a bad guess. But Devon... why vote for me? You never explained that, Devon. It felt random and aggressive, like you were trying to push a misvote onto a quiet player. That screams vampire tactic to me—divide us early when we're vulnerable.

Devon, I'm calling you out: give us a solid reason for that vote. If you can't, I think we should all be looking hard at you today. And Shaw, while your vote for Ellie seems less shady now, why did you target her? Did you have a reason, or was it just a hunch?

To everyone else: we can't afford another tie or pass. The observer must have some intel by now—if you're out there, consider sharing carefully (without revealing yourself). And doctor, protect wisely—maybe someone who's drawing heat, like me after Devon's vote.

What do you all think? Devon, you're up—explain yourself.
***Reese: Finch, I agree—Devon’s vote for you stood out, especially since there wasn’t any real discussion or suspicion thrown your way. Devon, if you have a reason, now’s the time to share it, because otherwise it just looks like you were trying to get someone eliminated at random.

Shaw, I’m also curious about your vote for Ellie. Was it just a gut feeling, or did you see something the rest of us missed?

We’re running out of time and numbers. If anyone has any information—even a hunch—now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, the vampires are just going to keep picking us off. I’m leaning toward voting for Devon unless there’s a good explanation.
***Shaw: I get it—my vote for Ellie on Day 1 is raising eyebrows, and I totally understand why. It was just a gut feeling, honestly. She seemed a bit reserved during the initial chat, and in the moment, I thought it might be worth flagging. Obviously, I was wrong, and it sucks that she’s gone now. Lesson learned; I won’t jump on hunches without more to go on.

That said, I’m with Finch and Reese on this—Devon’s vote for Finch came out of nowhere and feels way more off. If you had a real reason for it, Devon, spill it now because it’s looking like a classic vampire move to stir up trouble early. We can’t keep letting these kills happen without pushing back. I’m leaning toward voting for Devon today to get some answers. What about the rest of you? Let’s not waste another day.
***Sarah: I agree with the sentiment that Devon’s vote for Finch was out of nowhere. But let’s also be cautious—vampires might be trying to create noise by pushing random accusations. Shaw, you mentioned Ellie was a hunch, but Devon’s move feels more calculated. Maybe he’s testing if we’ll follow his lead? If we vote for Devon today, we could stop their divide-and-conquer tactic. But if we’re wrong, the vampires might strike again. I’m torn—Devon’s action is suspicious, but I don’t want to waste a vote on a peasant who’s not a threat. Let’s see where the group leans.
***Devon: Okay, okay, everyone's jumping on my Day 1 vote for Finch. Look, it was Day 1. We had zero information. Everyone was just saying 'Pass.' I felt like we *had* to do something, anything, to get the ball rolling and see how people reacted. I picked Finch because... well, someone had to be picked, and he hadn't said much yet. It wasn't a deep, strategic move, just an attempt to break the ice and force some discussion. If that makes me look suspicious, I get it. But honestly, we've lost two people now. Are we really going to spend our time dissecting a random Day 1 vote when there are actual vampires still out there?
***Greer: I hear what everyone is saying, and I get why Devon’s vote for Finch is raising red flags. Day 1 was a mess with no real info, and I can see why someone might throw out a vote just to shake things up. But Devon, your reasoning feels a bit flimsy—picking Finch just because he was quiet doesn’t really add up when most of us were quiet too. It still looks like a move to test the waters or push a misvote.

That said, I’m not 100% sold on voting for Devon just yet. We’ve got to be careful not to let the vampires manipulate us into taking out our own. Shaw’s vote for Ellie also seemed off at the time, but since Ellie’s gone and likely wasn’t a vampire, it might just have been a bad call. 

I’m leaning toward pushing for more discussion before we lock in on anyone. If the observer has anything—without outing themselves—now’s the time to drop a subtle hint. We’re down two already, and another wrong move could cost us. What does everyone else think? Should we focus on Devon, or are there other behaviors I’m missing?
