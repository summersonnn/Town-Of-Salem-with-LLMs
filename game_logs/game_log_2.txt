***Lester: Devon's death is a tough start. Since it's only Night 1, we don't have much solid info yet. Vampires probably chose randomly, but maybe they thought Devon was a threat—like a special role? Or just bad luck. 

I think we should all share any light suspicions or observations from yesterday's interactions. Nothing too revealing for special roles, but anything odd? For example, did anyone notice Devon acting strangely or anyone avoiding him? 

Also, remember the Clown might try to act suspicious to get voted out, so let's not rush to vote without reason. Let's discuss calmly.
***Elias: Since I protected Lester and Devon was killed, it means the vampires targeted someone else. I'm not sure who they targeted, but it's good to know that Lester is safe for now. I'll keep this in mind during our discussion. Let's hear from others and see if we can gather any information or suspicions.
***Fusco: Well, that's... unexpected. Morgan and Fusco just openly admitted to being the vampires? This has to be some kind of trick.

Look, I'm just a regular peasant here, but something's clearly not right with those two confessing like that. Either they're both the clown trying an extremely bold strategy, or one is the clown and the other is copying to create confusion.

I think we should be careful about voting either of them out right away. The clown wins if we vote them out, and this seems like exactly the kind of outrageous play a clown would make.

What does everyone else think about these "confessions"? Should we consider other suspects instead?
***Sarah: This is quite the chaotic start! Morgan and Fusco both claiming to be vampires is definitely suspicious - but as Fusco himself just pointed out, this could easily be a clown strategy.

I agree we should be very careful here. If one of them is the clown, voting them out means they win immediately. The real vampires would never openly confess like this on Day 1 - it would be game suicide.

Elias, I noticed you mentioned protecting Lester. That's interesting information to share so early. Are you claiming to be the Doctor? That seems risky to reveal on Day 1.

I think we should look beyond these obvious "confessions" and consider who might actually be vampires. The real vampires are probably sitting back quietly, enjoying this chaos. 

Has anyone else noticed anything suspicious? Root, Carter - you've been quiet so far. What are your thoughts on this situation?
***Carter: Hey everyone, sorry for being quiet. I've been trying to process everything that's happening. Morgan and Fusco claiming to be vampires is definitely throwing me off. I agree with Sarah and Lester that this could be a clown tactic to get voted out. It’s way too obvious for actual vampires to confess on Day 1.

Elias mentioning protecting Lester is also interesting. If Elias is hinting at being the Doctor, that’s a bold move this early. It could be true, or it could be a bluff to draw attention away from something else. I’m not sure yet.

I don’t have any strong suspicions right now since it’s so early, but I think we should avoid voting for Morgan or Fusco just yet. If one of them is the clown, we’d be handing them the win. Maybe we should look at quieter players or odd behavior from last night’s interactions. Root, what do you think about all this? And Morgan and Fusco, can you explain why you’d make such a wild claim? I’m curious to hear more.
***Root: Carter, I agree with you and others that this is a very strange situation. Morgan and Fusco's claims are so direct that it immediately makes me think of the Clown trying to get voted out. It's a classic move, almost too obvious. However, as Sarah pointed out, a real vampire could also be trying to create this kind of chaos, hoping we'd dismiss them as the Clown. It's a tricky situation.

I'm trying to process it all, and I don't have a clear suspect yet. I'm hoping Morgan and Fusco will elaborate on their claims, as you suggested, so we can understand their reasoning better. For now, I think we need to be very careful not to fall into a trap, whether it's from a Clown or a clever vampire.
***Morgan: So now that the night phase has ended and Devon is dead, let's reassess. The doctor protected Lester, which means if the vampires targeted Lester, the doctor saved him. But since Devon is dead, that means the vampires must have targeted him.

With that in mind, my next question is: did anyone notice anything unusual about Devon's behavior yesterday? Was he acting suspiciously or did he seem nervous? Maybe there's something we can use to figure out why the vampires targeted him.

***Carter: Hey everyone, it's really unfortunate that Elias was killed last night. Since he hinted at being the Doctor on Day 1, it’s possible the vampires targeted him to remove a potential threat. If he was the Doctor, we’ve lost a key role, and it’s even more important now to figure out who the vampires are.

I’m still suspicious of Fusco after his bold claim on Day 1. Even though we voted out Morgan, who also made a similar claim, Fusco’s behavior still feels off to me. It could be a clown tactic, but it might also be a vampire trying to confuse us by mimicking a clown strategy. I’m not ready to vote yet, but I’d like to hear more from Fusco about why he made that claim and what his thoughts are now.

Sarah, Lester, and Root, what do you all think about last night’s events? Did anyone notice anything odd about Elias before he was killed, or do you have any new suspicions? Let’s keep the discussion going and try to narrow down who might be behind these attacks.
***Lester: Elias being killed last night is a huge blow. Given how openly he hinted at being the Doctor yesterday, it makes perfect sense the vampires targeted him—they saw him as a major threat. If he truly was the Doctor, we've lost our best defense against night kills. 

Fusco, your "vampire" claim yesterday still bothers me. Morgan made the same claim and got voted out, but you're still here. Care to explain why you did that? Was it a misguided joke, or are you actually trying to get voted out like the Clown? Either way, it feels like you're playing a dangerous game that only helps the vampires by creating chaos.

Sarah, Carter, Root—let's pool our observations. Did anyone notice Elias acting strangely or anyone paying him unusual attention yesterday? Also, with only five of us left, we need to be extra careful. The vampires only need to eliminate one more non-vampire to win (since there are likely two vampires among us). 

Root, you've been quiet so far—any thoughts on who might be suspicious beyond Fusco? Carter, did anything stand out to you from yesterday's discussions? We can't afford to stay silent now.
***Root: Lester, Carter, you're right, I've been trying to piece things together, and Elias's death last night is a significant blow, especially if he was the Doctor. It suggests the vampires are being strategic, targeting roles that can hinder them.

Regarding Fusco's claim yesterday, I've been thinking about it a lot. Initially, like many of us, I considered it a potential Clown tactic because it was so overt. However, the more I reflect on it, the more I believe it points to him being a Vampire.

Think about it: a Clown wants to be voted out. While Fusco's claim might seem to achieve that, it also created immense confusion and chaos, diverting our attention. Morgan, who made a similar claim, was voted out. If it was a Clown strategy, why would two people do it? And why would one be eliminated while the other remains? It feels less like a desperate Clown trying to win and more like a calculated move by a Vampire to sow discord and survive.

His 'confession' now looks less like a plea to be eliminated and more like a clever way to manipulate the discussion and make us doubt our instincts. My strong suspicion is on Fusco being a Vampire. We need to seriously consider this, especially now that we've lost Elias.
***Sarah: This is getting intense. With Elias gone - likely our Doctor - we're in a very vulnerable position. Only five of us remain, and if there are still two vampires among us, they only need one more kill to win.

I have to agree with Root's analysis about Fusco. The double "vampire confession" strategy yesterday was bizarre, and while we initially thought it might be a Clown play, the fact that Morgan got voted out while Fusco survived is telling. A real Clown would have pushed harder to get themselves eliminated, not just made a vague claim and then backed off.

Fusco, you've been awfully quiet today after your dramatic confession yesterday. That's not typical Clown behavior - they usually keep pushing to get voted out. Your silence now makes me think you were hoping we'd dismiss you as the Clown and leave you alone.

Carter, Lester - what are your thoughts? We can't afford to make a mistake here. If we vote out the wrong person and the vampires kill tonight, it could be game over. 

I'm leaning toward voting for Fusco, but I want to hear from everyone first. We need to be united in our decision today.
***Fusco: I understand there's a lot of suspicion around me right now, and I need to clear things up. Yesterday was chaotic - I was trying to point out how strange it was that Morgan was making vampire claims, not claiming to be one myself. My comment was meant to highlight how bizarre those "confessions" were, not to join in on them.

Looking at what's happened: Morgan got voted out, and then Elias was killed at night. If I were a vampire, why would I have drawn so much attention to myself on Day 1? That would be a terrible strategy.

Root and Sarah, I understand your suspicions, but think about it logically - a vampire would try to blend in, not stand out. I'm just a regular peasant trying to survive here.

What's more concerning is how quickly everyone is rallying against me without considering other possibilities. Carter has been relatively quiet, and Lester has been directing suspicion away from himself by questioning others. Could one of them be the remaining vampire working with Morgan?

I'm willing to vote for whoever the group decides, but I think we need to consider all options carefully. We can't afford to make a mistake at this point.
