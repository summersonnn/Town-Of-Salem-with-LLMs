***Greer: That was fast. Only one night and Morgan is already gone. Anyone have any suspicions or want to share anything odd they noticed? We need to be careful with our votes.
***Sarah: Morgan’s death is a shock. I didn’t get a chance to talk to them last night, but I’ve been thinking—since there are two vampires, we need to act strategically. Does anyone remember if Morgan mentioned anything unusual before night fell? Also, maybe we should prioritize players who seem evasive or overly defensive during discussions. I’ll share my observations openly, but let’s not jump to conclusions. Who should we vote out to stay safe?
***Root: This is terrible news about Morgan. We need to be systematic about this - with two vampires among us, we can't afford to make random accusations.

I noticed Sarah is being very vocal about strategy right away, which could be genuine concern or deflection. But I don't want to point fingers without more evidence.

What I'm more interested in is hearing from everyone. The quiet ones might be trying to stay under the radar. Elias, Devon, Ellie - what are your thoughts? And Reese, you've been silent too.

We should also consider that the doctor might have tried to protect someone last night but guessed wrong. If the doctor is still alive, they have valuable information about who they protected.
***Elias: We lost Morgan tonight. That's a significant blow. With two vampires operating, we need to be extra cautious in our discussions and votes. I didn't get to interact much last night, but I'll do my best to stay vigilant.

My main concern is ensuring we don't eliminate a fellow peasant. We need to build a consensus on who might be the vampires. I'm not sure yet who to suspect, but I'll be looking for players who seem overly defensive or evasive in their responses. Let's focus on gathering information and not jumping to conclusions.
***Devon: Morgan’s death is definitely shocking. It all happened so quickly—makes me wonder if it was just random, or if the vampires saw Morgan as a threat. Do we have any clue about Morgan’s suspicions? If she happened to hint about suspecting anyone specific, that could be why she was targeted.

For now, though, I want to hear more from everyone else. Even if we only have bits and pieces of info, someone might have caught a small detail we can use. And we should be careful not to let confusion drive us to vote out a peasant.
***Ellie: This is really tough. Morgan was a valuable member of our group, and losing them so early is a big hit. I'm trying to think if there was anything Morgan said or did that might have made them a target. They were pretty quiet, so maybe the vampires thought they were an easy target or perhaps they had a special role.

I'm also concerned about the doctor's protection. If the doctor tried to protect Morgan and failed, that means the doctor might have used their one-time self-protection already, or they might have protected someone else. Either way, we need to figure out who the doctor is and work with them to maximize protection.

As for voting, I don't want to rush into anything. Let's see what others have to say and look for inconsistencies in their stories. Maybe someone will slip up and reveal something. I'll keep a close eye on the quieter players too, in case they're trying to avoid attention.
***Reese: The night has passed, and Morgan is gone. Now it's daytime. I'll play along and see how things unfold. Let's keep the discussion going and see if anyone starts to suspect me or Devon. For now, I'll just blend in and gather information.

***Greer: Another night, another loss. Sarah is gone now. That’s two people taken out by the vampires, and we still haven’t managed to vote anyone out. We need to get more organized or we’re going to lose more people fast.

I’m curious about the voting from yesterday—there were three people tied with two votes each: Reese, Greer (me), and Sarah. Now Sarah is gone. That could mean the vampires saw her as a threat, or maybe they just wanted to stir things up among those who got votes.

We need to hear from everyone. If anyone has information or suspicions, now’s the time to share. We can’t afford another wasted vote.
***Reese: It seems like we have a lot of discussion going on. I'll try to analyze the situation and share my thoughts.

First of all, two people are already gone, and we still don't have much information about who's a vampire and who's not. 

From the voting yesterday, it seems like Reese, Greer, and Sarah were all targeted. Now Sarah is gone, which could mean the vampires saw her as a threat or wanted to eliminate someone who was getting too suspicious.

I'm a bit concerned about the fact that some people are already making accusations and voting for specific targets. We need to be careful not to eliminate the wrong person.

As for me, I don't have much information to share yet, but I'm listening to everyone's discussions and trying to figure out who might be a vampire.

Let's keep talking and see if we can gather more information. 

Also, I think it's interesting that Reese and Greer both got votes yesterday. Now that Sarah is gone, I'm starting to wonder if one of them might be... 

I'll stop here and let others share their thoughts.
***Devon: This is so frustrating. We lost Sarah last night, and that’s two gone now with no real leads. We can’t keep missing our chances during the day. 

I’m thinking about yesterday’s votes. We ended up with a three-way tie between Sarah, Greer, and Reese. Now Sarah’s out. If the vampires saw her as a threat, maybe she was onto something—or they’re just picking off people who had multiple votes to stir chaos.

We need to watch how people respond today. If anyone acts overly relieved that Sarah’s gone, that might be telling. At the same time, we shouldn’t get tunnel vision on one clue. Root and Elias haven’t talked much about their suspicions, so I’m curious to hear from them now. 

Let’s keep sharing thoughts. If someone has a lead or noticed anything subtle last night or during the day’s discussion, speak up. We can’t afford another missed opportunity.
***Ellie: I think we need to focus on the people who received votes yesterday. Since Sarah is gone, maybe the vampires were trying to protect someone who was getting too many votes. Let's look at Greer and Reese again. 

Also, what about the doctor? If the doctor protected someone last night, they might have valuable information. But since the doctor can only protect themselves once, maybe they tried to protect Sarah and failed. 

I'm not sure who to trust, but I think we should keep the discussion going and see if anyone else has insights. Let's not rush into voting without more information. 

What do you all think? Should we try to get more information out of the people who were quiet yesterday? Like Root and Elias? 

I'm also a bit suspicious of Devon. They haven't said much, but maybe they're just being cautious. 

Let me know your thoughts.
***Root: Looking at yesterday's voting pattern and what happened overnight, I have some serious concerns about Reese.

Yesterday, Reese received votes from both Greer and myself. Now that we've lost Sarah, who also received multiple votes, I'm wondering if the vampires targeted her to deflect attention from someone else who was getting heat.

What really bothers me is how Reese has been responding. Their messages feel... calculated. Like they're trying to blend in without actually contributing much substance. And when they did speak, they seemed to be analyzing the situation from a distance rather than genuinely trying to help us find the vampires.

I've been observing carefully, and my instincts are telling me Reese might be one of our vampires. The way they've been deflecting and staying neutral while others take stronger stances is suspicious.

I think we need to seriously consider voting for Reese today. We can't afford another tie - we need to start eliminating threats before we lose more innocent people.

What does everyone else think? Am I reading too much into this, or does anyone else get a bad feeling about Reese?
***Elias: I've been observing the situation carefully, and I must say, your suspicion about Reese is something I've noticed too. They haven't been very active in the discussions, which can be a red flag for some players. But I'm not sure if that's enough to act on right now.

I've also been trying to figure out who the doctor might be. If the doctor is still alive, they could have protected someone last night, but since Morgan and Sarah were killed, maybe the doctor tried to protect one of them and failed. That might give us a clue about who the doctor is.

I'm not comfortable jumping to conclusions just yet. We need more information before we start voting people out. Let's see if we can get more out of the group discussion today. Maybe we can ask some pointed questions to see how others react.

What do you think? Should we focus our suspicion on Reese for now, or should we keep an open mind and wait for more information?

***Greer: No one died last night, which means the doctor finally protected the right person. That’s a huge break for us. Whoever the vampires targeted was saved, so someone here is definitely a target.

I’m going to be honest: I protected Root last night. I was suspicious that the vampires might go after someone who’s been vocal and pushing the discussion forward. Since Root is still here, that means the vampires tried to kill them and failed.

This should clear Root of suspicion for now. We need to focus on the people who keep getting tied in votes—Reese and Devon, I’m looking at you. I think it’s time we stop splitting our votes and actually eliminate someone who’s been acting suspicious.

Let’s not waste this chance. If anyone else has information, now’s the time to share.
***Root: Interesting that no one died last night - that means the doctor made the right call. And Greer just claimed to be the doctor and said they protected me. 

But here's what I know for certain: **Reese is a vampire.** I've been watching them carefully, and I'm absolutely sure about this.

Greer, if you're really the doctor, then you saved me from the vampires last night. That would explain why they targeted me - maybe they suspected I was getting too close to the truth about Reese.

I think we need to focus our votes on Reese today. We can't afford another tie. The evidence is mounting:
- Reese has been deflecting and staying neutral
- They received votes yesterday but survived while Sarah didn't
- Their responses feel calculated rather than genuine

Everyone, we need to coordinate our votes. If Greer is telling the truth about being the doctor, then we have a real chance here. Let's not split our votes again.

What do you all think? Are we ready to vote out Reese?
***Devon: I’m not entirely convinced about Greer’s claim. Sure, it’s possible they’re the doctor, but it’s also pretty convenient to claim credit for the protection the moment no one dies. It could be a strategy to gain our trust and direct suspicion elsewhere. The real doctor might just be lying low, letting Greer paint a target on their back.

Let’s not forget that we’ve had two nights of kills before this, where the “doctor” didn’t manage to save anyone. Suddenly, on the third night, Greer says they made the right call. Maybe they did—maybe they didn’t.

Root seems eager to blame Reese, but I’m not sure if that’s justified or just an easy target. Honestly, the constant ties we’ve had feel orchestrated. Could be that the vampires keep orchestrating a split. Let’s just think carefully before we all rally against one person on unverified info. If Greer’s lying, we could be handing the vampires an easy majority if we vote off the wrong person.

I’d like to hear more from the quieter players too, like Elias or Ellie. They haven’t contributed much lately, and that silence could be hiding something. Let’s keep talking.
***Reese: Let's keep playing this carefully. I've been trying to blend in and gather information, but it's getting harder to avoid suspicion. 

I think Greer's claim about being the doctor is interesting. If they're telling the truth, that means they've been trying to protect us. But what if it's just a clever ruse to gain our trust?

I've noticed that Root has been pretty vocal about their suspicions, and Greer's been trying to defend themselves. Maybe we can use this to our advantage. If we can make Root seem like a threat, we might be able to take them out.

Devon, what do you think? Should we try to stir up some suspicion around Root, or keep playing it cool?
***Elias: I've been trying to stay under the radar, but it's getting harder to avoid suspicion. I'm not sure if I'm being too quiet or if that's exactly what the vampires want. 

I think Greer's claim about being the doctor is interesting. If they're telling the truth, that means they've been trying to protect us. But what if it's just a clever ruse to gain our trust?

I've noticed that Root has been pretty vocal about their suspicions, and Greer's been trying to defend themselves. Maybe we can use this to our advantage. If we can make Root seem like a threat, we might be able to take them out.

Devon, what do you think? Should we try to stir up some suspicion around Root, or keep playing it cool?
***Ellie: I think we need to focus on the people who have been getting votes. Greer and Reese have been tied before, and now Greer is claiming to be the doctor. I'm not sure if I believe that, but if they are the doctor, then they might have valuable information.

I've been quiet because I don't want to draw attention to myself, but I think it's time to speak up. I don't have any information about who the vampires are, but I'm willing to listen to others' suspicions.

Let's try to figure out who the real threats are. If Greer is the doctor, then they might know who the vampires are targeting. If not, then they could be lying to throw us off their trail.

I'm not sure who to trust, but I think we need to make a decision soon. We can't keep having tied votes and losing people at night. Let's work together to find the vampires and eliminate them.

***Devon: I can’t believe Greer was killed last night. I was really starting to think Greer might be the doctor after claiming to protect Root. If that was true, then the vampires must have seen them as a major threat.

At this point, we’ve only got four of us left: Root, Elias, Ellie, and me. One of us is definitely a vampire. We need to make this next vote count, or we risk losing another innocent. Since Greer was targeted so quickly after claiming to be the doctor, I’m kind of suspicious about who would benefit most from silencing them.

Root, you seemed like you trusted Greer after they said they saved you. Now that Greer’s gone, do you still feel confident you’re not a prime target? Elias, Ellie—what’s your read on the situation?

We need to piece together why Greer became a target right after revealing that information. It feels like someone wanted them out of the picture ASAP. Let’s talk it out thoroughly before making a final decision on who we vote out next.
***Ellie: I think we need to focus on the remaining players and figure out who the vampires are. Since Greer was killed last night, and they claimed to be the doctor, it's possible that the vampires targeted them to eliminate a key role.

I'm not sure who to trust at this point, but I think we should consider the voting patterns and the behavior of the remaining players. Root has been pretty vocal about their suspicions, and Elias has been quiet. I'm not sure about Devon either.

Let's try to gather more information and see if anyone else has insights. We can't afford to make a mistake now. If we vote out the wrong person, the vampires could win.

What do you all think? Should we try to get more information out of the group discussion today? Maybe we can ask some pointed questions to see how others react.

I'm also a bit suspicious of Root. They were protected by Greer, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're innocent. The vampires might have wanted to keep Root around for some reason.

Let me know your thoughts. We need to work together to figure this out.
***Elias: I'm a bit overwhelmed by all this. Greer was killed last night, and they claimed to be the doctor. I don't know what to make of that. Root seemed to trust Greer after they said they saved them. Now that Greer is gone, I'm not sure if Root still feels the same way.

I've been trying to stay quiet, but I think it's time to speak up. I don't have much information, but I'm willing to listen to others' suspicions. Let's try to figure out who the real threats are. If Greer was the doctor, then they might have known who the vampires were targeting. If not, then they could be lying to throw us off their trail.

I'm not sure who to trust, but I think we need to make a decision soon. We can't keep having tied votes and losing people at night. Let's work together to find the vampires and eliminate them.
***Root: Looking at what's happened, I'm now certain about who the vampires are. I've been gathering information each night, and I know for sure that both Reese and Devon are vampires.

Reese was voted out yesterday, which means Devon is the remaining vampire. With Greer gone - and if Greer was telling the truth about being the doctor - we've lost our protection.

Devon, your behavior has been suspicious from the start. You've been deflecting attention, questioning others' claims, and trying to sow doubt. When Greer claimed to be the doctor, you immediately tried to discredit them. Now that Greer is dead, you're trying to cast suspicion on me.

Elias and Ellie, we need to vote out Devon today. If we don't, and there's still one vampire left, we could lose tonight. The math is simple - with four of us left, if Devon is the vampire and we don't eliminate them, they could potentially win.

I'm confident in this assessment. Devon has been playing the long game, staying under the radar while others drew attention. But their responses and voting patterns give them away.

We need to end this today. I vote for Devon.
